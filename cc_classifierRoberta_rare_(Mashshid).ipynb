A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.\\n\\nEnvironmental guilt was more effective than the green \\\"good for the planet\\\" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.\\n\\nBritish consumers already are used to the \\\"traffic-light\\\" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.\\n\\nA new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.\\n\\nTheir study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThey tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.\\n\\nThey had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, \\\"This item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change,\\\" to green one which read, \\\"This item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.\\\"\\n\\nThe study found red labels to be the most effective at 23.5% more than the comparative choosing nonbeef in the control group.\\n\\nOnly 10% of people chose green, compared to the control group.\\n\\nThe lead author of the study, professor Julia Wolfson, an expert in food policy at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the results showed an effectiveness with the red-style labeling.\\n\\n\\\"We found that labeling red meat items with negatively framed, red high\\u2013climate impact labels was more effective at increasing sustainable selections than labeling non-red meat items with positively framed, green low\\u2013climate impact labels,\\\" she said.\\n\\nWolfson added those who were likely to choose green labels tended to eat healthier than the control. This is despite no fast food included on the menu.\\n\\nShe said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.\\n\\n\\\"It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,\\\" Wolfson said.\",\n          \"Russia \\u2013 Exposure of \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019 plans caused panic in Kiev \\n\\n Russia \\u2013 Exposure of \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019 plans caused panic in Kiev\\n\\n\\u201cMany signs\\u201d show Ukraine is winding down its program amid Moscow\\u2019s revelations, a senior diplomat claimed\\n\\nKiev might be shelving its alleged \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019 program after Russia exposed it, Moscow\\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday.

For those of you that have not been paying attention, the apocalyptic alliances that we have been anticipating for years have now formed.

All of the marbles are at stake, and both sides have plenty of nuclear weapons.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, China\\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi publicly declared that his nation is \\u201cready to join forces with the Russian side\\u201d\\u2026\\n\\nThe People\\u2019s Republic of China is ready to join forces with Russia to decisively stand up for national interests and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China\\u2019s Central Committee, said on Tuesday as he met with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev.\\n\\n\\u201cDuring a virtual meeting at the end of last year our leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin \\u2013 TASS) came up with a plan for further development of bilateral relations. We are ready to join forces with the Russian side, in accordance with the high-level agreements, to decisively stand up for national interests and virtues, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nAnd the Wall Street Journal is reporting that plans are being made for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to travel to Moscow for a high level summit with Vladimir Putin\\u2026\\n\\nChinese leader Xi Jinping is preparing to visit Moscow for a summit with Russia\\u2019s president in the coming months, according to people familiar with the plan, as Vladimir Putin wages war in Ukraine and portrays himself as a standard-bearer against a U.S.-led global order.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Chinese are using increasingly harsh words to describe U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine\\u2026\\n\\n\\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf8\\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\udde6\\ud83c\\udde8\\ud83c\\uddf3\\u201dFight to the last Ukrainian.The US has pursued a policy of fighting ti the last Afghan in Afghanistan\\u201d- Chinese Foreign Ministry pic.twitter.com/3Cih0f2Rra\\n\\n\\u2014 AZ \\ud83d\\udef0\\ud83c\\udf0f\\ud83c\\udf0d\\ud83c\\udf0e (@AZgeopolitics) February 22, 2023\\n\\nAnd the Chinese are now calling for the UN to investigate the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines\\u2026\\n\\nChina has called on the United Nations to investigate the explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, describing the blasts as a \\u201cdeliberate act\\u201d by state actors.\\n\\nAt a UN Security Council briefing on Tuesday, Chinese ambassador Zhang Jun said China shared the position of many countries in calling for an investigation \\u201cto uncover the truth and identify those responsible\\u201d.\\n\\nSo why would China request such an investigation?\\n\\nBecause they know that we did it.\\n\\nAnd we know that they know that we did it.\\n\\nAnd they know that we know that they know that we did it.\",\n          \"'Woke' Scientists Want Fast Food Menus to State Environmental Impact \\n\\n Some scientists are pushing for warnings on foods such as fast food burgers to display they are bad for your health, joined with their impact on the planet.\\n\\nA group of American researchers tested the climate-change warnings on fast food menus and found they encourage people to make more sustainable dietary decisions.\\n\\nThe labels were colored-coded. A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.\\n\\nEnvironmental guilt was more effective than the green \\\"good for the planet\\\" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.\\n\\nBritish consumers already are used to the \\\"traffic-light\\\" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.\\n\\nA new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.\\n\\nTheir study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThey tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.\\n\\nThey had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, \\\"This item is not environmentally sustainable.

This is despite no fast food included on the menu.\\n\\nShe said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.\\n\\n\\\"It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,\\\" Wolfson said.\",\n          \"Russia \\u2013 Exposure of \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019 plans caused panic in Kiev \\n\\n Russia \\u2013 Exposure of \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019 plans caused panic in Kiev\\n\\n\\u201cMany signs\\u201d show Ukraine is winding down its program amid Moscow\\u2019s revelations, a senior diplomat claimed\\n\\nKiev might be shelving its alleged \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019 program after Russia exposed it, Moscow\\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday. He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.\\n\\nOver the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a \\u2018dirty bomb\\u2019, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material.

However, the reality of DeSantis as a bandwagoneer is brutally obvious to anyone who followed the previous effort and the backlash against West Virginia.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s good to see Florida join the effort.\\n\\nI\\u2019m glad Florida followed West Virginia\\u2019s lead in pulling money away from BlackRock.\\n\\nThank you @RileyMooreWV for leading the way on this many months ago. pic.twitter.com/aTh8LfilC0\\n\\n\\u2014 Alex Bruesewitz \\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf8 (@alexbruesewitz) December 1, 2022\\n\\nThank you @JimmyPatronis!!

Climate crazies tried \\u2014 and failed \\u2014 to glue themselves to Edvard Munch\\u2019s 1893 painting \\u201cThe Scream\\u201d in Oslo on Friday.\\n\\nIt was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked \\u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring\\u201d by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh\\u2019s \\u201cSunflowers\\u201d and John Constable\\u2019s \\u201cThe Hay Wain\\u201d in London over the summer.\\n\\nThe new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci\\u2019s \\u201cMona Lisa\\u201d in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.\\n\\nIn addition, \\u201cPeach Trees in Blossom\\u201d by Van Gogh; \\u201cMy Heart\\u2019s in the Highlands\\u201d by Horatio McCulloch; \\u201cTomson\\u2019s Aeolian Harp\\u201d by J.M.W. Turner; \\u201cThe Last Supper\\u201d by Giampietrino; \\u201cSistine Madonna\\u201d by Raphael; and \\u201cHaystacks\\u201d by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.\\n\\nAs of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.\\n\\nVideo of Friday\\u2019s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.\\n\\n\\u201cI scream for people dying,\\u201d one of the activists shouted.\\n\\n\\u201cI scream when lawmakers ignore science,\\u201d the other shouted.\\n\\nThe Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to \\u201cStop Oil Exploration,\\u201d claimed responsibility for the attack.\\n\\nThe group demands that the Norwegian government declare \\u201can immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,\\u201d and present \\u201ca concrete plan for fair adjustment for today\\u2019s oil workers.\\u201d\\n\\nA spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to \\u201cpressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe are campaigning against \\u2018Scream\\u2019 because it is perhaps Norway\\u2019s most famous painting,\\u201d said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. \\u201cThere have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.\\u201d\\n\\nBut there\\u2019s good press and there\\u2019s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.\\n\\nNorway is one of the world\\u2019s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.\\n\\nWithout much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.\\n\\nThe art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:\\n\\n\\u201cIn recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,\\u201d read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.\\n\\nThese climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped \\u201cproblem\\u201d peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week.
