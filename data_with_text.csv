 The Washington Free Beacon reported that BioMADE, a public-private partnership that has received more than $500 million from the DoD, is responsible for the endeavor. BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include ""novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein"" – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.

Lab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval - Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)

But according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.

Critics argue that using U.S. troops to test lab-grown meat, which is still experimental and not widely available in stores, is inappropriate. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.

Jack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. ""Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,"" he remarked.

""Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals. Unfortunately, this effort is being driven by an agenda that is political and anti-farmer. Our soldiers should never be used as guinea pigs.""

Even Ethan Lane, vice president for government affairs at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, has criticized the DoD research grant that bankrolled BioMADE.

""It is outrageous that the DoD is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to feed our heroes like lab rats,"" he said in a statement. ""This misguided research project is a giant slap in the face to everyone that has served our country. Our veterans and active-duty troops deserve so much better than this.""

""U.S. cattle producers raise the highest-quality beef in the world, with the lowest carbon footprint – and American troops deserve to be served that same wholesome, natural meat and not ultra-processed, lab-grown protein that is cooked up in a chemical-filled bioreactor.""

THE GREAT CLIMATE CON

Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.

Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.

.

Just recently there was a day of action by activists to kick start the year of fighting back. We predicted the UK was just getting started with their resistance, and here we have it. Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers.

Now that’s quite beautiful to see.

Further action

There are further planned dates for activists to take to the streets in various forms of protest.

Piers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January., Starting at Southwark tube in London.

Then an event which has potential to draw a large crowd with reports coming in people are making the trip down from as far as Manchester is taking place in Oxford on the 18th of February.

It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con. Continued coverage will be given on our website, newsletter and social media. Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023.

 Actress Jane Fonda’s latest performance as a climate change activist drew a slew of criticism as she protested the Alberta oil sands in the Canadian province.

Fonda was castigated by locals, ambushed by a social media reporter and criticized by a left-leaning provincial premier. On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement.

Fonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.

“I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”

But there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”

Fonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.

“I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said.

On the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.

Picard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.

The episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”"

 A Tesla Owner Just Exposed A Sick Secret About Electric Cars…

The left has been preaching global warming, cooling, climate change, and end-of-the-world nonsense since before many of us were born.

In his book An Inconvenient Truth: The Crisis of Global Warming, Al Gore attempted to persuade everyone that the globe was overheating.

Democrats are always negotiating deals that place the United States at a competitive disadvantage with other countries, some of whom are our foes, such as Communist China.

They manipulate children into doing their bidding by convincing them that they only have a few years to live.

For them, it’s a pretty decent racket. However, there is another viewpoint.

Economic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.

Leftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.

Brad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.

Despite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.

“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.

“That was too early, far before their rated life.”

“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”

Electric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.

Like Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.

Nonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.

Regular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.

Given that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.

Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls

— Patrick De Haan ⛽️📊 (@GasBuddyGuy) November 11, 2021

Microplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.

“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.

While proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before."

 Another of the world’s most recognized and most valuable pieces of art was the target of climate-change activists. Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.

It was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.

The new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.

In addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.

As of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.

Video of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.

“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.

“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.

The Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.

The group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”

A spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”

“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”

But there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.

Norway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.

Without much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.

The art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:

“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.

These climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week. If they truly believe the hype surrounding climate change, they’re targeting the wrong thing."

 Karachi - Unity Foods continues to showcase a strong commitment to ESG principles through a partnership with The Green Ark (TGA). A MoU was signed to this effect between both companies whereby TGA will collect and transform scrap materials from Unity Foods to create a diverse array of recycled products intended for reuse. The initiative aims to facilitate the circular economy by mitigating the impact of single-use plastics that contribute significantly towards the deterioration of global ecosystems.

Unity Foods regularly undertakes lasting projects that align with its objectives to reduce the impact of conventional industrialisation on the environment. Under the current partnership with The Green Ark, a leading recycling solutions provider, Unity Foods will not only ensure the traceability of its packaging waste but also highlight a robust commitment to a greener environment by contributing to the circular economy. With an average of more than 13,000 kilogrammes of waste every month including items like garbage debris, oily pouches, plastic jerry cans, tin scraps, plastic bags, and cardboard cartons, a substantial amount of materials will be recycled which will not end up in landfills or incinerators that ultimately damage nature.

“Global warming is a present and potent threat, especially for Pakistan which despite producing a negligible level of greenhouse gases, faces the brunt of the consequences of this global phenomenon. At Unity Foods, we always aim to set a precedent, particularly with our ESG practices that underscore our commitment to ensuring our children can inherit a safe and healthy planet. This partnership with The Green Ark is another step in this direction and we aim to continue commencing similar initiatives in the future,” commented Ms Nageen Rizvi, Head of Corporate Communications and Sustainability, Unity Foods at the signing ceremony.

 A group of UK-based climate activists, called the Tyre Extinguishers, is moving around deflating the tyres of parked SUVs (sports utility vehicles) on roads in an effort to combat global warming.

The group has claimed credit for tyre-deflating operations in American cities including New York City, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and cities in England, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Italy among others, according to a report by Fox News.

“Reports coming in of very angry #CarShaggers who are upset they can’t drive their massive tanks around Lisbon. Oh no! Welcome to the fun, Portugal! We will make SUVs history,” the group posted on Twitter along with an image of a Portuguese-language pamphlet the activists left on one of the targeted SUVs.

On their own website, the “Tyre Extinguishers” who believe in guerilla climate activism explain why they are protesting against SUVs. The group’s website has details and instructions on how to quickly deflate tires on parked cars. It also has a template for pamphlets that activists can use during their operations. Once the person deflates the tyres, they leave a document with a headline stating, “ATTENTION - your gas guzzler kills,” on the vehicle’s windshield explaining to its owner why such action was taken.

“You’ll be angry, but don’t take it personally. It’s not you, it’s your car. We did this because driving around in urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others,” the pamphlet reads.

“We are people from all walks of life with one aim: To make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world’s urban areas,” the group’s website adds.

“We are defending ourselves against climate change, air pollution and unsafe drivers. We do this with a simple tactic: Deflating the tyres of these massive, unnecessary vehicles, causing inconvenience for their owners,” the website points out.

Tyre Extinguishers is a “leaderless, autonomous movement of groups that act independently,” according to their website.

“SUVs and 4x4s are a disaster for our health, our public safety, and our climate. Bigger and bigger cars are dominating our towns and cities, all so a privileged few can flaunt their wealth. Because governments and politicians have failed to protect us from this danger, we must protect ourselves. We want to make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world’s urban areas. We do this by deflating the tyres of these massive, unnecessary vehicles, causing inconvenience and expense for their owners,” says the website of the organisation."

 BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er, southwest China, embodies the wisdom of China's agrarian culture and is an example of positive interaction between people and nature, and of their sustainable development, a Chinese official has said.

Li Qun, deputy minister of culture and tourism and head of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua. The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday during the extended 45th session of the World Heritage Committee ongoing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With the addition of this new listing, China's number of UNESCO World Heritage sites has risen to 57. The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er is the very first tea-themed world cultural heritage site globally.

On what makes this site stand out and on what sort of cultural insights it offers, Li said the cultural landscape comprises five ancient tea forests, nine traditional villages and three protective forests, which maintain their vitality to this day.

""According to archaeological findings, the cultivation of tea trees in ancient China can be traced back over 6,000 years,"" Li said. ""Subsequently, tea culture and the practice of growing and consuming tea spread from China to neighboring countries and beyond.""

The cultural landscape has resulted in a unique protection system combining government management with grassroots governance, which ensures the protection of cultural and biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, Li said.

This heritage, he said, also demonstrates the unique tradition of the complementary use of natural resources in mountainous environments by many of China's ethnic groups.

Its success in achieving World Heritage Site status is ""a significant achievement in presenting an authentic picture of ancient and modern China to the world,"" the official said.

China plans to implement preservation and management initiatives in five key areas, Li said.

Emphasizing the importance of prioritizing protection and planning ahead, Li highlighted the need for the coordinated planning of protection and management measures for ancient tea forests, villages and traditional residential architecture. Such an approach aims to strike a balance between heritage preservation and development.

Furthermore, China intends to invest in research on core technologies to enhance its monitoring capabilities for ancient tea forests as well as rare flora and rare fauna, and its capabilities for climate change responses.

To promote the sustainable development of its heritage sites, China aims to improve the participation mechanism for locals and other stakeholders. The involvement of local communities, particularly people from younger generations, will be encouraged and guided to contribute to the dissemination of tea culture and the growth of the tea industry.

China will continue to delve into the history of the tea industry, explore the philosophical depth of tea culture, and elucidate the global influence of Chinese tea culture. The country seeks to tap into the value of this heritage and promote its traditional culture further.

The official said that efforts are underway to promote the effective utilization and regulated development of cultural World Heritage Sites, aiming to breathe new life into these invaluable treasures. ■"

 Pakistan’s collaboration with Chinese construction companies offers a unique opportunity to leverage their vast expertise to expedite its infrastructure and real estate development and adopt efficient construction techniques while ensuring high-quality standards and promoting sustainable practices.

Dr. Liaqat Ali Shah, Head of Policy CPEC in the Centre of Excellence for CPEC, said this while talking to WealthPK.

“The Chinese investment under the CPEC is mainly focused on infrastructure. The largest part went into setting up power generation plants, railway tracks, and building highway infrastructure. The CPEC's western alignment was also the focus of new infrastructure projects, which connected Pakistan's most underdeveloped regions with Gwadar and major urban centres.”

“Owing to China’s rapid urbanization in the last two decades, Chinese construction companies have had a lot of exposure to efficient construction techniques, which has given them a lot of expertise in these fields,” he said.

“Collaborating with Chinese construction firms allows Pakistan to benefit from these high-quality standards, contributing to the construction of a durable and resilient infrastructure. This is particularly crucial in regions prone to natural disasters, as the expertise garnered from the Chinese practices can help in designing and constructing buildings that can withstand various environmental challenges,” he opined.

“As the world collectively embraces the imperative of sustainable development, the Pak-China partnership aligns seamlessly with these global goals. Both nations recognize the importance of environment-friendly construction practices and adoption of green building materials.”

“Through joint research initiatives and knowledge-sharing, the collaboration will be instrumental in achieving the targets related to climate action and responsible consumption and production.”

“Implementing focused training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives is crucial for cultivating a skilled and competitive construction workforce in Pakistan,” he suggested.

He further informed WealthPK that more than 5,000 trained and experienced Chinese engineers and workers and more than 2,000 Pakistani engineers and workers were involved in different projects under the CPEC.

According to the SBP Annual Report 2023, the construction industry recorded a contraction of 5.5 percent in FY23, after registering a moderate growth in the previous two years. Increase in input prices and wages, higher borrowing costs, and slower growth in development spending are the main factors which constrained the construction activity during FY23."

 UK weather maps: Met Office issues yellow warnings over 70mph winds

The fierce winds are accompanied by a surprising change in temperature.

Met Office forecasts strong winds for the north

Crushing waves will slam the UK’s shores while power cuts and travel delays are likely as 70mph batter the country.

The Met Office has placed a yellow weather warning for wind as strong gales are predicted for much of the northeast of the UK. The weather warning covers Highlands & Eilean Siar and Orkney & Shetland in Scotland.

However, some experts predict heavy winds will also hit other coastlines along the UK. The “spell of very windy weather” is likely to lead to “travel disruption”, the weather agency said.

This includes impacting coastal routes and sea fronts with large waves, as well as possible loss of power and other services.

Delays to road, air and ferry transport are also “likely”.

While the worst of the winds will hit along the coast, speeds could still reach a substantial 60mph inland.

The weather warning is in place until 11am, although winds will remain throughout the day for much of the country.

The weather agency said: “Winds will increase quickly towards dawn Saturday across the Northern Isles with gusts generally reaching 50-60mph but with a smaller chance of 70mph gusts. Winds will quickly ease from late morning.”

The winds will accompany slightly warmer temperatures than in recent days. The mercury is likely to reach 13C in Belfast and 12C in Glasgow, both typically in the colder regions of the UK.

However the country is still reeling from the impact of Storm Isha and Storm Jocelyn.

With the ground saturated in various regions, the flood risk remains high.

Nine flood warnings were last night in place across England alone, including an alert for River Ouse in York city centre. The river burst its banks this week.

The closely consecutive storms has been attributed to the recent positions of jetstreams influencing low-pressure systems from the Atlantic. However, weather experts have also explained to Express.co.uk that climate change is likely having an impact on the number and severity of storms.

Met Office 5 day weather forecast

Today:

Outbreaks of rain slowly sinking south across northern Scotland, and slowing over the mainland. Elsewhere, dry with sunny spells, although cloudier later in the west with patchy drizzle. Very strong winds in the north, but lighter in the south. Mild.

Tonight:

Rain slowly returns north through the evening. Cloudy with drizzle in the north and west, but drier elsewhere with clear spells. Windy, with gales in the north. Mild for most.

Sunday:

On Sunday, remaining wet and windy in northwest. Generally dry in southeast, but cloudy at times, although some brighter spells possible. Very mild.

Outlook for Monday to Wednesday:

Turning more unsettled into the new working week, with some drier interludes, but less wet and windy than seen recently."

According to a WEF report, white people are responsible for the vast majority of the world’s problems including climate change and colonialism, and in the interests of an equitable future for the globe, the number of white people must be reduced as a priority.

The WEF has enlisted the United Nations to help with the plan and the results are already playing out before our eyes.

The Netherlands has become one of the global elite’s testing grounds for the most extreme policies.

Just as the Netherlands was ground zero for the elite’s war on farmers, Dutch cities are also operating as laboratories for the elite’s plans to depopulate the world and radically alter demographics.

Eva Vlaardingerbroek reports from the Netherlands.

What is wrong with our leaders?

They are fully bought and paid for compromised reprobates who have hitched their wagon to the globalist agenda and take their orders directly from Davos.

Catching the elite in “mask off” moments is nothing short of terrifying.

Take for example footage of a top CDC official saying that the elites must “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” and replace them with immigrants to create a more compliant society.

Dr. Carol Baker was describing what she described as the “solution” at a panel discussion in New York City.

You won’t be surprised to hear that Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Barack Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary in 2009.

She was also honored with the 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a D.C. ceremony sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Is anyone surprised that a Bill Gates-connected CDC official is openly suggesting depopulating America of white people who don’t cooperate with the elite’s vaccine agenda?

This is the same Bill Gates who told world leaders that it’s time to talk about “death panels” that will sentence ordinary, law-abiding people to death for the crime of being of no use to the elite.

This is the psychopathic world Bill Gates and his associates at the WEF are determined to usher in as part of their Great Reset and Great Replacement.

It gets even worse when you understand how far and wide their evil ideology has spread.

The globalist elite are no longer hiding their plans to depopulate the world by reducing the number of white people. This is a multi-pronged attack and we are now seeing what it looks like in real time.

Of course, the mainstream media are still operating under instructions from the elite to attack anybody who dares to express what they can see with their own two eyes.

They will attack you, shout you down, and pressure your employer to fire you. You might lose your bank account.

You are simply not allowed to talk about the human tragedy of Biden and Harris’ open border, even though Biden is on record laying out his great replacement vision in 2015 in plain English for everybody to understand.

Biden is a compromised puppet politician who has been shamelessly selling out America to the globalists for decades.

Now that he has been sacrificed by the global elite in favor of Kamala Harris and appears to have been replaced by a body double who is approximately eight inches taller than the last version, it is worth pointing out that the elite think we are incredibly stupid.

They really think we are not paying attention to the mountains of evidence proving the multi-pronged attacks maiming and killing the population all have one thing in common.

Chemtrails and mRNA disproportionately target white people in a way that is statistically impossible unless it’s by design.

Of course the plot to depopulate the world has been planned out in detail. The Covid vaccines have long been exposed as a bioweapon designed to cull the herd and depopulate the world.

But it gets even worse, as Robert F. Kennedy explained in New York City. The bioweapon is targeted to take out white people and spare other races.

We can’t allow the evil logic of ethnic bioweapons to become the new normal.

Bill Gates has the right to fly around the world on private jets while normal people are forced to live in 15 minute cities without freedom of travel, according to Bill Gates himself, who told the BBC he is doing much more than anybody else to fight climate change.

Gates claimed that because he continues to “spend billions of dollars” on climate change activism, his carbon footprint isn’t an issue.

“Should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria?” Gates said in the interview with Amol Rajan.

“I’m comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy Group is spending, that I’m part of the solution,” Gates added. Watch:

Earlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.

Gates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.

A study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.

Gates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.

Elsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.

While the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein."

 A few globalist-owned and controlled animal feed companies are supplying farmers with tainted chicken feed that allegedly prevent hens from producing eggs, adding to the chaotic food shortages and supply chain breakdowns. Is this another attempt to cripple the entire food supply, including meat and eggs, so everyone will run to the grocery stores and buy genetically-mutated, lab-concocted Franken-meat that Bill Gates funds? It would appear so.

Not only are hens unable to lay eggs for months after consuming globalist-manufactured tainted feed, but could it be possible those chickens and eggs are also toxic for humans to consume, possibly causing infertility issues for them also? Local egg suppliers and farmers are blowing the whistle on what could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporations purposely trying to cripple the meat and egg supplies of this country, driving inflation through the roof.

Ever since October, several American egg farmers have experienced ZERO egg production from their chickens, until they switched their feed to a different kind, some even going with goat feed. Now, suddenly, the chickens are laying eggs again, almost back to the normal rate. What is the explanation? Chickens do produce fewer eggs in the winter due to the shorter daylight hours and molting (shedding of feathers), but they don't usually completely stop laying.

Many of these farmers say the mass media and Big Food are using the avian flu outbreak as a cover story for the egg laying problem, but that still doesn't explain why every chicken had completely stopped laying eggs while on the tainted food regimen. What companies are the farmers pointing the finger at?

Purina's Dumor brand and Tractor Supply's Producer's Pride brand of chicken feed. These are the culprits, and if you follow the money up the line, it leads straight to the corporate gurus and globalists who are urging all humans to stop eating meat and eggs, and start eating grub worms and cockroaches, in order to save the planet from… global warming. Sure. Meanwhile, at the Davos convention, the globalists are all eating salmon and steaks. So, you were saying?

It's now more than obvious there is a deliberate war on food being waged against civilians by the globalists. Centralized suppliers, especially those that supply rural farmers that are mostly Conservatives and Republicans, are obviously out to cripple the egg supply, as strong evidence comes from two particular brands of feed these farmers use regularly.

This tragedy is forcing people to connect the dots and realize that it's not just the hen food that's causing production and infertility problems, but the human food as well. Egg farmers are now on the record saying, “If they are willing to poison my chickens to prevent me from supplying myself or others with eggs, then surely they would poison the food I eat and feed my family.”

There is a massive public awakening happening now, as food prices soar and supplies get choked out. More people are dying right and left from ""unknown causes"" and it's getting worse by the day. People are dropping dead from heart attacks and strokes and many fewer humans have been having babies over the past few years, since the scamdemic began. Coincidence? It's population reduction, and it's a war being waged using food, medicine, viruses, dirty vaccines, and supply chain dismantling.

 Photo taken on April 19, 2021 shows a quantum science experimental satellite model exhibited during the 1st Summit of Jinan National Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Application (JNAIIA) Pilot Zone & the Exposition of Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Application on Yellow River Basin in Jinan, east China's Shandong Province. (Xinhua/Guo Xulei)

BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- China strives to make frontier breakthroughs in science and technology via the advancing computing power of artificial intelligence (AI) that has seen explosive growth in the country.

Scientists and AI developers applauded the revolution of AI-driven scientific research at the two-day AI for Science Summit in Beijing, which started on Thursday.

""AI development benefited from science,"" said Tang Chao, a professor from the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies (AAIS) at Peking University, at the meeting. ""Now, we're looking forward to embracing a stage where AI facilitates scientific progress.""

AI for Science (AI4Science) can form an interdisciplinary platform and help scientists to solve complicated problems to improve research efficiency and quality, said E Weinan, president of the AI for Science Institute in Beijing.

AI4Science demands four pillars of infrastructure -- algorithm models and software, effective measures to represent experimental data, database and knowledge repository, and integrated computing platform, said E.

The Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Natural Science Foundation of China jointly kickstarted a project to promote the use of AI in frontier sci-tech research in March.

The project will deploy AI models and algorithms in gene research and biology breeding breakthroughs.

Also, interdisciplinary research and development teams will be brought together to promote the establishment of an innovation consortium and build international academic exchange platforms to offer solutions to human scientific challenges, including cancer treatment and the climate crisis.

E said AI4Science might bring revolutionary changes in new materials, energy, aviation, and pharmaceuticals.

Using AI and one of the world's fastest supercomputers, Chinese scientists have already started to engineer otherwise unknown chemicals to be clinically used in the future.

With the Tianhe-2 supercomputer in south China's Guangdong Province, scientists and computer experts with Beijing-based AI startup Galixir developed a practical deep-learning toolkit to predict the biosynthetic pathways for natural products, the primary source of clinical drug discovery.

Empowered by AI-based algorithms, the computer also offers clinicians tools to discern types of gastric cancer and discover signs of nasopharynx cancer among high-risk populations.

The new application scenarios are also a source of opportunities for the AI industry. ""Scientists can bring giant advancement to AI when they're solving problems,"" said Wang Jian, director of Zhejiang Lab. ■"

 Strong winds and heavy rains have hit Spain and Italy causing widespread flooding and devastation

Train services between France and Italy have been halted until Thursday at the earliest, after a huge rock slide in the Maurienne valley in the French Alps. It also blocked some roads, officials said on Monday.

Regional authorities in Savoie said the rockslide occurred at 5:15 pm (1515 GMT) on Sunday, when ""boulders with a total volume of 700 cubic metres (25,000 cubic feet)"" slammed into a protective barrier along the RD 1006 road that leads to the Mont-Cenis pass into Italy's Susa valley.

The landslide forced the suspension of all cross-border trains on the Chambery-Turin line, as well as TER regional trains in the Maurienne valley, French rail operator SNCF said.

The Frejus tunnel connecting France and Italy under the Alps has also been closed to heavy trucks, whose drivers are being advised to use the Mont Blanc tunnel or the A8 motorway instead.

French Transport Minister Clement Beaune said a return to normal services ""will require several days"".

""After this massive landslide yesterday in Maurienne, our services are mobilised to restore road and rail service as quickly as possible,"" he said on social media.

Spain's Mediterranean coastline was hit Sunday by violent winds and heavy rain, which caused several minor injuries and substantial material damage and disrupted several flights.

Gusts of up to 120 km/h, downpours and sometimes hail hit the Balearic Islands and the regions of Catalonia and Valencia, all three of which were partially placed under orange alert (high risk) on Sunday by the National Meteorological Agency (Aemet).

The weather is part of a violent storm that broke out on Sunday morning, blowing down numerous trees, causing flash flooding and damaging a bullring in the town of Felanitx.

The thunderstorms left motorists having to navigate treacherous conditions.

The wind also broke the moorings of a 330-metre tourist cruise ship moored in Palma, on the island of Mallorca, displacing it until it collided with a moored oil tanker.

The accident caused six minor injuries, the Port Authority of the Balearic Islands said in a statement.

At least 24 flights were cancelled and 29 were diverted to and from the Balearic Islands on Sunday, Spanish airport operator Aena announced.

Heavy rains led to an accumulation of more than 100 litres of water per square metre in some parts of Catalonia in the middle of a drought. In Vilassar de Mar, firefighters rescued a motorist whose vehicle was dragged by the water and became trapped under a bridge.

Powerful winds and torrential rain also poured in Northern Italy, first in Lombardy on Saturday, when heavy storms uprooted trees and damaged roofs and then on Sunday in Liguria.

People in Genoa on Sunday morning were caught off-guard by the heavy rainfall and a high alert remains in place for most of Monday in Liguria.

The Poppea cyclone, coming from the North of Europe, is pushing its way across the country and it is set to sweep away the summer heat wave.

Wildfires continue to rage in parts of Greece

Meanwhile, wildfires have continued to rage in parts of Greece. A fire that broke out on the Cycladic island of Andros on Saturday, probably caused by lightning, was brought under control by Sunday as firefighters remained in key hotspots as a precaution due to strong winds blowing in the area.

Firefighting efforts focused on the front near the village of Vitali. 73 firefighters with 18 fire trucks were operating at the scene, while two aircraft and two helicopters provided assistance from the air.

With hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires however, European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of such fires, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017."

 Stakeholders at a programme on Sunday said that collaborative strategies and innovation were keys to unlocking Bangladesh’s circular apparel industry for availing a significant opportunity for the country to reduce its environmental impact, improve its economic performance and create social benefits.

The readymade garment sector in Bangladesh is under a transformative journey towards circularity, but embracing circularity also poses certain challenges that must be collectively considered and resolved, they said.

A panel of industry leaders, policymakers and experts in circular economies made the comments at an event titled ‘Switch to Upstream Circularity Dialogue: Pre-consumer Textile Waste in Bangladesh’ at the Amari Hotel in Dhaka on Sunday.

The event was organised under the Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project (SWITCH2CE), co-funded by the European Union and the government of Finland.

Parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of environment, forest and climate change chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury was present in the opening session as chief guest.

Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Faruque Hassan spoke at the opening session as special guest.

Deputy head of European Union to Bangladesh delegation mission Bernd Spanier, SWITCH2CE chief technical adviser Mark Draeck, among others, also contributed to the event’s opening session.

Hilde van Duijn, head of Global Value Chains, Circle Economy, also participated in the event and made circular game demonstration.

Faruque Hassan said, ‘Living in a world in our time where climate is most threatened, business as usual is no more an option. In a race to zero emission and resource decoupling, circularity emerges as the “next normal” linking business and sustainable development. For the BGMEA, circularity sits in the core of our values, mission and vision. Our goal is to help conserve the natural eco-system as much as possible via an economic shift from a linear to circular system, while generating greater social and economic values.’

Mark Draeck said, ‘With the support of the European Union and the government of Finland, UNIDO leads the global Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project.’

‘In Bangladesh, we support the circular transition for the textile and garments industry, by piloting innovative circular solutions in close cooperation with global and national industry leaders, which as BESTSELLER, H&M and their manufacturers,’ he said.

‘These pilots will address acute challenges on new technology, business models and traceability, and will demonstrate the economic opportunity for circular approaches.

The project also collaborates with government partners, academia, and NGOs to create an enabling environment for circularity through policy and tailored capacity building,’ he added."

 We accept the named legislation “Inflation Reduction Act” (IRA) is a legislative misnomer intended to obfuscate the true construct of the bill. The IRA was factually the ‘green new deal’ program packaged under the guise of an ‘inflation reduction’ premise. However, in order to discuss the outcome of the content we have to play the game of pretending around the purpose of the legislation.

Within the IRA there was a $7,500 tax credit for American made Electric Vehicles. The intent of the legislation was to provide incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase ‘sustainable’ and environmentally friendly electric cars, trucks, SUV’s etc made in America.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored the bill with this legislative intent in mind. However, the Treasury Department is now taking apart the granular details of the legislation in order to qualify foreign made vehicles for the $7,500 credit. The rules interpretation from the Treasury Dept essentially negates the CBO score, and the outcome is going to be much more expensive than initially stated.

Because the $7,500 comes in the form of a tax credit, the IRS (Treasury) is the institution making the determinations for qualification. Treasury is changing the qualifications to permit basically any EV to qualify, by parsing a difference between a leased vehicle and a purchased vehicle. Additionally, Treasury is changing the battery sourcing aspect by qualifying essentially any trade agreement as a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), saying the term Free Trade Agreement was undefined in the legislation.

As an outcome & simply cutting to the chase, EV batteries from just about anywhere, inside EV vehicles from basically anywhere, that are purchased as leases from just about any auto manufacturer, will qualify for the $7,500 credit. It’s all a shell game, with the Biden administration determining where the pea is located.

Dec 29 (Reuters) – The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday that electric vehicles leased by consumers starting Jan. 1 can qualify for up to $7,500 in commercial clean vehicle tax credits, a decision that makes those assembled outside North America eligible.

The announcement is a win for South Korea and some automakers that earlier this month sought approval to use the commercial electric vehicle tax credit to boost consumer EV access. Automakers said the credit could be used to reduce leasing prices.

The $430 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August ended $7,500 consumer tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles assembled outside North America, angering South Korea, the European Union, Japan and others. The new Treasury guidance does not change the definition of what constitutes North American assembly to make more vehicles eligible for EV purchases.

Treasury said it was using “longstanding tax principles” to determine consumer leasing could qualify for the EV tax credit.

The IRA also imposes significant battery minerals and component sourcing restrictions, sets income and price caps for qualifying vehicles and seeks to phase out Chinese battery minerals or components. The commercial credit does not, however, have the sourcing restrictions of the consumer credit.

Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the chamber’s energy panel, urged Treasury to pause implementation of both commercial and new consumer EV tax credits and said they had bent “to the desires of the companies looking for loopholes” and would seek new legislation that “prevents this dangerous interpretation from Treasury from moving forward.” (read more)

From the Wall Street Journal, “One of the documents released Thursday pointed out that because the legislation doesn’t define what a free-trade agreement is, the Treasury Department might consider other types of trade agreements to expand the eligibility. The department didn’t provide examples of such agreements, but trade lawyers have suggested that the 2019 bilateral trade agreement with Japan and the World Trade Organization’s government procurement agreement could be candidates.” (link)

I am reminded of the words from Democrat Congressman Alcee Hastings during the construction of the ObamaCare legislation. WATCH (10 secs):

.

Once again using language to obscure reality.

It is a funny thing to see the BS passed into law and then the Treasury department”deciding” who gets the taxpayer money as an incentive to buy a car made with Cobalt mined by slaves in Africa.

Indentured slaves, but non the less, it’s children doing the mining, yet it’s for the environment. I also wonder how many trans children are forced to work in this mining operation because then it would be a double tragedy for a poor black trans kid committing environmental suicide while mining the cobalt so some snot-nosed Gen Z puke can drive an environmentally friendly car.

The things I wonder about sometimes, – I know I am a racist.

Funny that this is about the same amount the EV’s increased in price a few months back."

 Republican lawmakers will probe the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and large private investors for their role in pushing an environmental agenda throughout the financial sector after the midterm elections.

Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street’s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don’t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria. (RELATED: Kentucky Officials Demand Proof That State Pension Funds Aren’t Used For Woke Investing)

“My view is that ESG investing is a cancer within our capital markets,” Barr told the Post. “It is a fraud on American investors.”

Barr and other Republicans hope to force SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to answer questions on the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require all publicly traded companies to disclose their carbon emissions and climate change risks, the Post reported. The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the “climate risks” of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors’ influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.

“We’ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms’ climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.

Republican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.

BlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm’s stance on climate change.

The Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers."

A viral image shared on X, formerly Twitter, purports to show 20-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book.

— I,Hypocrite (@lporiginalg) November 28, 2023

Verdict: False

The image is digitally altered. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.” A spokesperson for Thunberg confirmed the image was fake in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

Thunberg has been criticized for chanting “crush Zionism” at a recent pro-Palestine rally in Sweden, according to the Times of Israel. Nigel Savage, founder of the Jewish non-profit Hazon, said Thunberg and other members of the political left “have been intellectually captured by a naive, distorted and frankly bigoted anti-Zionism,” the outlet reported.

The X image, viewed over 800,000 times, purports to show Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book. “On The Jews And Their Lies,” the title of the book appears to read. The book is supposedly written by German priest and theologian Martin Luther.

The image is digitally altered, however. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.”

“I’m so pleased to share that The Climate Book is now available in the USA and Canada! I have gathered the wisdom of over one hundred contributors to highlight the many different crises we face and equip us with the knowledge we need to avoid a climate disaster,” Thunberg wrote in the first of two posts promoting the book.

“This is the biggest story in the world, and it must be spoken as far and wide as our voices can carry and much further still. Thank you for your support!

I will not earn money from this book as my copyright belongs to the Greta Thunberg Foundation, so all royalties go to charity,” she added in the second post.

 The Treasury Department announced Tuesday that it is moving to amass data from private insurance companies to assess the financial risks of climate change on homeowners across the country.

The department’s Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is proposing a new regulation that will gather homeowners’ and businesses’ data from property and casualty insurers, according to a press release. The FIO will use the data to determine whether private insurance coverage will be disrupted in areas of the nation that are vulnerable to “climate change impacts.”(RELATED: The Fed’s Plan To Battle Inflation Could End Up Making Energy More Expensive. Here’s How)

“FIO’s data collection will add to the work of regulators and policymakers across the Administration to assess climate-related risks to the financial system, the U.S. economy, and the American people,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement provided by the press release.

If the regulation is implemented it would apply to all large property and casualty insurers; however, it would not apply to small insurers with policies worth less than $100 million, with the exception of those in 10 high-risk states as determined by The Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a summary of the proposal. The information would be gathered by ZIP code and would not include information about individual homeowners’ policies but would also request data from five years ago to determine market patterns.

President Joe Biden signed an executive order in May 2021 to direct the FIO to assess the risk that the “climate crisis” poses to private insurance coverage. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a government office of financial regulators, deemed climate change to be an “emerging and increasing threat,” according to an October 2021 report.

“Today’s action by the Federal Insurance Office is an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change,” Yellen stated.

A video shared on Facebook claims the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change.

Verdict: False

The claim is false. The idea was proposed via a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and serves as a collaboration between NOAA and NASA, but has not been put into practice. A NASA spokesperson denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

In the Facebook video, an unnamed male claims NASA is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change based on an article from Unilad. The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.

The claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.

According to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”

“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.

Likewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. In fact, the opposite is true. Both Lead Stories and USA Today debunked the claim in Mar. 8 and Mar. 15 articles, respectively. (RELATED: No, 80 Percent Of Texas’ ‘Cattle Grazing Land’ Was Not Destroyed By Recent Fires)

Additionally, the claim is neither referenced on NASA’s website nor its verified social media accounts. NOAA also has not publicly commented on the claim.

NASA Spokesperson Allard Beutel denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

“This is an unfortunate mischaracterization of a study done by another agency. As this was a study, NASA is not planning to inject ice into the stratosphere,” Beutel said."

 Unfortunately, a new poll shows that the majority of Americans believe to some extent the unscientific climate doom propaganda that has been consistently wrong for half a century. The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.

Pew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:

- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.

- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.

I have previously explained in more detail how “green” energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, “green” energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those “green” electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.

Perhaps Americans are starting to realize that:

[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.

You mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!

If Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):

- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.

- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040

One very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.

— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) February 7, 2023

By the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.

It is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years. But it is encouraging that Americans are not falling hook, line, and sinker for some of the lies around electric vehicles and fossil fuels.

We don’t need to give up our cars to save the planet. It’s all just a political deception.

 The Federal Reserve’s credibility is in tatters.

It predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed. To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.

The result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]

Examples of climate activism abound.

This year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.

A query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.

With all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.

These studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.

In the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.

I showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.

More recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.

The original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.

I managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.

The author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.

There are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.

China had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.

The paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.

Omitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.

There’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.

A warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.

Debate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.

The paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.

The only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.

The Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.

 Business Finland is hosting an unprecedented visit by a large delegation from the North American forest and wood products industry, marking a significant milestone in international collaboration. Over 60 delegates from nine U.S. states and Nova Scotia, Canada, are touring Finland to gain insights into the country's advanced forestry practices and innovative wood-based technologies.

For five days, the delegates will visit various Finnish industrial plants, research institutions, and universities.

They will explore forestry management, wood construction, and logging practices across southern, central, western, and eastern Finland. The aim is to familiarize the North Americans with Finland's forest expertise, sustainable forest policies, carbon reduction strategies, and the diverse operations of the Finnish forest industry.

Ulla Lainio, Senior Advisor at Business Finland Washington D.C., stated, ""The large group is touring industrial and forest sites to share knowledge about forestry, forest management, wood building, and logging. This visit reflects the significant interest in Finland's forest innovations.""

The delegates are particularly interested in Finland's manufacturers of forest machines and wood construction equipment, as well as new bio-products such as wood-textile fibers, wood-based building materials, and biofuels. The goal is to foster collaboration in smart forestry, forest health, wood construction, and biomass sectors.

The U.S. forest industry has traditionally been underutilized due to cheap fossil energy and abundant hydropower. However, with the Biden administration's renewed focus on combating climate change, there is a growing interest in biofuels, biomass utilization, forest fire prevention, and advanced forest management technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act provides grants and tax incentives for the forestry sector, making this an opportune time for international collaboration.

Wooden house building is common in North America, with a high demand for suppliers of wood construction equipment, prefabricated house solutions, and CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) and LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) production lines. The delegation aims to find efficient construction solutions to address housing shortages and achieve carbon neutrality.

Finland, along with Sweden, is a global leader in the forest bioeconomy. The North American delegation seeks partners in both industry and research to support the renewal and diversification of the forestry sector.

Outi Suomi, Circular Transition for Zero Waste Mission Lead at Business Finland, emphasized, ""The forest policy is now favorable for reforms, and there is unprecedented interest towards Finland. The collaboration and mutual business opportunities for Finland's and North America's forest industries are significant.""

During their stay, the delegation will visit notable companies and research institutions, including Koskisen, Veisto, VTT, Pinomatic, UPM, Stora Enso, Metsä Group, Ponsse, University of Eastern Finland, John Deere, Business Joensuu, Natural Resources Institute Finland, Kira Hub, and Aalto University. They will also meet with over 25 forest sector companies showcasing innovative wood-based products, advanced wood construction techniques, and forest fire prevention solutions.

The delegation includes top officials responsible for forest use from Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, Colorado, Arkansas, California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Nova Scotia, as well as representatives from leading research universities, sawmills, major forestry companies, forest owners, logging companies, wood architecture firms, and investors.

This historic visit is expected to pave the way for significant collaborations and advancements in the global forest industry, highlighting Finland's pivotal role in sustainable forestry and wood innovation.

EN_CC_100042.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Protest-Driven Change 

 Safeguarding the interests of the wheat growers, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to increase the wheat procurement target demonstrates a positive shift in government policy and reactiveness.

In a powerful example of peaceful and legitimate protest, the farmers’ protest was successful in influencing the policies of the state. The complaints of delays in wheat procurement and the exploitation by flour mills that were offering rates lower than the government-mandated price have been heard and addressed by the state.

The government’s decision not only addresses the grievances of the farmers but also reflects its willingness to listen to the concerns of the citizens and adjust government strategies in a timely manner – something we have been governmentally lacking for quite some time now.

The PM directed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited to ensure the swift buying of wheat from these farmers. This is the epitome of how citizens can hold the government accountable, reforming the governance policies and driving a positive change in society.

However, the issue of wheat prices is still an issue – one that may not exactly be in the hands of the state. Support prices set by the provincial governments vary, as can be seen in the case of Balochistan and Sindh. Their respective prices are not adjusted to the recent inflation and have been carried on from last year’s wheat prices.

This is further aggravating the concerns of the farmers who are facing a higher cost of production owing to the higher energy and fertilizer costs. Not only does this make it challenging for the farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce, but it also does not take into account the impact of global warming that has further worsened their troubles. Heavier showers this year have adversely affected the harvesting season and crop yields for these farmers, and this needs to be accounted for.

The government’s efforts to address their concerns are a good step, but we need to extend more support to them in these difficult times. If we want to be more proactive in our governance, then considering the long-term implications of climate change on our agriculture will be wise moving forward.

Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme precipitation disproportionately affect our farmers, jeopardizing their sole source of income. As such, the state must stand by vulnerable farming communities and formulate policies to mitigate the impact, ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the nation."

 A Belgian region’s environmental and social conditions for research funding offer a possible model for the EU.

By Anthony King

In the EU and Belgian capital Brussels, Barbara Trachte reflects the strengths of a third governmental layer in Europe: its numerous regions.

Trachte is secretary of state of the Brussels-Capital Region responsible for the economic transition and scientific research. The first member of Belgium’s French-speaking Green party to be put in charge of an economic portfolio, she shows the scope for bottom-up EU policy changes.

Setting an example

Trachte helped put in place a Brussels law that, starting in 2024, has made regional subsidies for research organisations, companies, public administrations and civil society conditional on respect for social and environmental standards. She believes the EU should do the same for its €95.5 billion research programme known as Horizon Europe.

‘Sometimes you need a revolution – or at least a mini revolution,’ Trachte told Horizon Magazine.

She said that Europe’s regions have a key role to play in advancing the continent’s transition to a net-zero economy.

With the EU seeking to become climate neutral by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Horizon Europe has placed increasing emphasis on projects to hasten the switch towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels and to ensure the process is socially fair.

Already the third-biggest part of the EU budget, Horizon Europe would have even greater impact on green and social matters across the continent by following the example set by the Brussels-Capital Region.

In a nutshell, €50 million of subsidies granted annually by the region for research and innovation require recipients to respect a do-no-harm principle and have a positive impact on the environment or social equality, according to Stephanie Lepczynski, who is Trachte’s policy adviser.

‘We are showing the way and we hope that this can influence the European Commission by encouraging it to put environmental, social and governance criteria into the eligibility of Horizon projects,’ Lepczynski said at the European Research and Innovation Days event in Brussels on 20-21 March 2024.

Secrets to success

Gender and transborder-cooperation requirements currently in place for EU funding help ensure greater diversity in research teams and produce scientific results that better reflect the make-up of society, according to Lepczynski.

She said that social and environmental conditionality in Horizon Europe would force researchers systematically to check that they’re acting for the common good and help ensure that funding advances EU green and social goals.

Trachte said such conditions will also be merited in the successor programme of Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years through 2027.

‘I wish for the next EU framework programme to decide the same – to have a greater impact and make a bigger contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal,’ she said.

For Trachte, EU projects can have the most impact where academic, industry, government, civil society and the environment interact.

This is known as the “quintuple helix” approach to innovation. It has led governments increasingly to prioritise public involvement in innovation processes.

‘This ensures that research is rooted in society and geared towards finding solutions to today’s major societal challenges such as climate degradation, growing socio-economic inequalities or democracies,’ Trachte said.

Mission driven

She singled out as particularly important the five Horizon Europe “Missions”: adapting to climate change, fighting cancer, restoring oceans, cleaning up soil and establishing 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.

‘The five Missions are a very innovative tool to make the societal challenges stand out – in particular the triple crisis of climate, biodiversity and pollution and the health challenges related to it,’ Trachte said.

In Brussels, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was notably successful in bringing together regional and local administrations as well as other partners from the private sector.

‘The enthusiasm created behind the Missions has mobilised many different actors,’ Trachte said.

The views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.

 s the world faces the critical challenge of climate change, building nurseries has become one of the key ways to mitigate its effects through reforestation and restoration efforts.

In Indonesia, a notable project is the Rumpin Nursery in Bogor, which has emerged as a prominent model of public-private partnership in supporting Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink initiative. Established in 2022, the Rumpin Nursery was inaugurated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and is the result of a collaboration between the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Public Works and Housing Ministry, and APRIL Group, a pulp and paper producer.

APRIL Group's nursery system in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau province, inspired the Rumpin Nursery development, which has the capacity of planting approximately 200 million new seedlings per year. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development to increase plantation fiber productivity.

Over the next three years, the Indonesian government plans to build 30 nursery centers, each with an annual production capacity of 10 to 12 million seedlings, which will result in a combined annual production of 360 million seedlings. These seedlings will be used to rehabilitate and restore degraded lands, to be planted on critical land, areas with high landslide potential and upper reaches of river basins (DAS).

The Rumpin Nursery has successfully grown and planted thousands of native tree species, including Manglid, Sengon, Salam and Sirsak. Since President Jokowi's inauguration last year, the nursery has begun distributing seedlings in a number of locations such as the Ciliwung River. Following the Rumpin Nursery's successful collaboration, the government is currently focusing on developing additional nurseries in other regions, including Danau Toba, Likupang, Mentawir and Bali.

By replicating and scaling up such models, Indonesia can unlock the potential of nurseries and other nature-based solutions to achieve its ambitious climate goals. This public-private partnership has enabled the Rumpin Nursery to align with the Indonesian government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89 percent unconditionally by 2030, as per the updated NDC.

As part of its efforts to support Indonesia's restoration and forestry goals, the APRIL Group recently earned an appreciation award for its role in the public-private collaboration that established the Rumpin Nursery.

PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper, the operating arm of APRIL Group, also received an appreciation award for its work to improve the performance of industrial forest plantations. Both awards were presented by Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya and received by Sihol Aritonang, president director of PT RAPP.

""APRIL is proud that our technology and seed management system can serve as a reference for nursery development in Indonesia. Through the Rumpin Nursery, we show our continuous support for one of the government's activities in achieving FOLU Net Sink 2030,"" said Sihol.

Indonesia's Forestry and Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink is the newest forest policy in Indonesia that identifies the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) absorption targeted to be equal or higher than emissions in the FOLU sector in 2030. The Net Sink FOLU is projected to contribute up to 60 percent of the Net Zero Emission target by 2060 as part of the country's efforts to achieve its climate goals under the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The key targets of Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 include efforts to ensure reduced deforestation and forest degradation, the importance of sustainable forest management, social forestry and land rehabilitation, biodiversity and ecosystem preservation."

 ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that his country will learn from China's experience to eradicate poverty and enhance exports to increase foreign exchange reserves, the Prime Minister's Office said.

In a meeting held in his office, Sharif said that China's success in lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty serves as a role model for Pakistan, the office said in a statement.

He added that Pakistan wants to benefit from China's experiences in increasing exports which will act as a major step to increase foreign exchange reserves and decrease poverty.

""Pakistan and China share longstanding and deep brotherly relations which are strengthening over time,"" he said, adding that China has always helped Pakistan in difficult times, for which he, along with the entire nation, is grateful to the Chinese leadership and people.

The prime minister encouraged Chinese companies to set up industries in Special Economic Zones being established under the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Launched in 2013, CPEC, a flagship project of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, is a corridor linking Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province with Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which highlights energy, transport and industrial cooperation.

The prime minister said thorough preparations are being made for CPEC's new phase and its successful initiation will further strengthen economic relations between Pakistan and China.

The prime minister emphasized that Pakistan, being an agricultural country, is committed to adopting the modern techniques and technology of China in agriculture to increase productivity.

He also invited Chinese companies to set up plants for electric and hybrid vehicles in Pakistan to help the country achieve the goal of shifting to electric vehicles in the transportation sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change. ■"

Highlighted in a recent report by The World Financial Review. “Malik Riaz, Asia’s largest real estate developer, has set an example that might inspire other Pakistani entrepreneurs to step forward and address the needs of an increasingly low-income population” says the report.

Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s commitment to addressing hunger and poverty in Pakistan through initiatives like Bahria Dastarkhwan has garnered significant praise. Some globally well-known newspapers i.e. News Week, CNN, Los Angeles Times, EuroAsia Industry and The National already have recognized Malik Riaz Hussain and Bahria Town’s social welfare initiatives. The article statEs that in a country where economic challenges persist and government resources are stretched thin, Bahria Town has stepped up to fill critical gaps in social welfare. From providing free meals to hundreds of thousands through Bahria Dastarkhwan to mobilizing rescue teams during natural disasters, Bahria Town’s efforts have touched the lives of millions.

Furthermore, the article reads as Malik Riaz’s belief in mutual prosperity drives such philanthropic initiatives, aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Pakistanis. While recognizing the limitations of private initiatives, Bahria Town remain hopeful for increased government support to amplify its impact further. Moreover, the report asserts that as climate change exacerbates challenges in Pakistan, Bahria Town remains steadfast in its commitment to serving communities in need. Bahria Town’s relief operations during the 2022 floods underscore its dedication to humanitarian causes. The global acknowledgment of Bahria Town and Malik Riaz’s efforts underscores the pivotal role of the private sector in addressing societal challenges.

 Letters to the Editor: Oil companies are killing the planet. Now they want to sell us a fake solution?

To the editor: Let’s recognize “carbon management” for what it is — a fossil fuel industry euphemism for commodifying pollution and providing life support to this dirty industry. While urgent action is needed to address the climate emergency, carbon capture is not a real solution. (“Will storing CO2 in old oil fields slow global warming? First California plan nears approval,” Jan. 14)

The process in question requires vast amounts of energy and water. The presence of oil wells and pipelines can result in dangerous and potentially deadly leaks. That’s especially true of improperly plugged wells in the oilfields that companies like California Resources Corp. want to use as carbon dumping grounds.

Carbon capture and storage projects divert funds away from what is truly needed: a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and rooftop solar.

Rather than marking “a drastic transformation for fossil fuel companies” and communities, as oil industry supporters claim, carbon management is nothing more than corporate greenwashing intended to keep these polluting companies in business.

Victoria Bogdan Tejeda, Oakland

The writer is a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.

..

To the editor: Let me see if I understand this correctly.

California Resources Corp. wants to utilize its depleted oil fields to store carbon emissions deep underground. This company polluted California for decades, for profit, and now it wants to utilize the same ground that is basically a wasteland of little to no value to store carbon emissions that resulted from the extraction of its product in the first place.

The company made unbelievable amounts of money extracting fossil fuels that have resulted in the loss of many lives through their detrimental effects on the environment. Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.

I think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades. But then again, there would be no profit in that.

 ISLAMABAD - Ambassador of Denmark, Jakob Linulf has said that carbon markets are a new opportunity for Pakistan to improve its economic situation and reduce carbon emissions for a green development through sustainable and environment friendly practices.

Climate change was casting adverse impacts on the globe and it was equally important for Pakistan and Denmark to develop strategies for averting its risks to humanity and biodiversity, said Ambassador Jakob Linulf while addressing to the one-day capacity building workshop for journalists on Climate-Smart Reporting: Carbon Market and Equitable Development jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and the Embassy of Denmark here Thursday.

He said Denmark had completed its green transition and transformed its energy sector from a fossil fuel-dependent energy mix to a greener one based on solar, wind, and biomass. “Denmark has faced a lot of challenges in the way and that’s why it wants to share its lessons learnt with Pakistan so that it do not repeat the same mistakes,” he said. The Danish ambassador noted that the Danish companies had adequate technologies to address climate change impacts which can collaborate with their Pakistani counterparts.

“Pakistan is facing double crises; economic crisis coupled with climate change as the 2022 floods inundated one third of the country leaving millions of millions displaced and billions of dollars livestock, infrastructure and ready to harvest crops washed away,” he said. He highlighted that carbon market can be an important tool in developing right and efficient tools to benefit from latest mechanisms to cut carbon emission and address climate change but it should be considered as a financial facility alone. He said the business leaders can take the lead to influence green transition especially in the sectors of steel, fertiliser, and cement where carbon adjustment can be one tool alongwith fuel adjustment and waste management. Soren Lutken, Chief Carbon Market Special UNEP Copenhagen said carbon markets is not the only solution to climate crisis as it was not exactly the idea to reduce but shift the emissions from one place to the other.

He said Pakistan is the host of the cheaper emissions reduction mechanism whereas it was imperative to break the myth that it has missed the train to address Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He said the country needed to come up with a clear policy framework to decide its moment to enter the compliance carbon markets. “There are cooperations available globally that are interested to buy carbon credits that needs to be explored efficiently with clear policy direction and leadership,” he said. Nadeem Nawaz, Special Advisor and Country Manager at Danish Energy Agency and Global Cooperation provided a brief presentation on the long-term energy planning strategies of Pakistan towards 2050.

He said Pakistan needs to be chalk out a credible roadmap that will lead to tempt more investors in the realm of carbon credits’ training. In his opening remarks, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI said journalists can shape public opinion and guide policymakers on adopting efficient carbon markets, whereas the think-tank and media both can benefit from each other’s experiences to reduce carbon emissions. “It is important to highlight the urgency of climate change and the critical nature of the transformative power of carbon markets as South Asia is suffering from many environmental crises,” he said."

 What fresh nonsense is this? Climate ‘reparations’ are coming, to compensate other countries for the ‘extreme weather’ they’ve been experiencing, which is allegedly our fault, because a model which has always been wrong said so. The U.K. has now backed the transparent scam. The Telegraph has more.

Britain has opened the door to paying climate change reparations to developing countries by supporting talks on the issue at the COP27 summit.

On Sunday, at the meeting in Egypt, U.K. negotiators backed a last-minute agreement to address “loss and damage” payments to countries badly affected by climate-related disasters.

Rishi Sunak will appear at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, where he will pledge £65.5 million for green technology in developing countries.

The Prime Minister will say: “By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.”

Boris Johnson will also deliver a speech warning against the “naysayers” who threaten Net Zero targets.

Pakistan is leading a push by developing countries including Bangladesh and the Maldives for compensation from richer countries responsible for most of the world’s pollution.

The U.K. backed the issue being on the COP27 agenda during two days of negotiations ahead of the Egypt summit and is understood to accept that a deal must be done over the economic cost of climate change, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2050.

On Sunday night, a Downing Street source said Mr Sunak planned to “scale up progress and support” for developing countries suffering the worst effects of global warming.

The Prime Minister will come under pressure in Egypt to agree to a costly deal on reparations at the same time as he draws up plans for sweeping domestic tax rises and spending cuts.

On Sunday night, Treasury sources said Jeremy Hunt had signed off up to £35 billion in spending cuts and up to £25 billion in tax hikes to fill an estimated financial black hole of £60 billion.

Labour has backed calls for the U.K. to pay other countries affected by climate change, with Ed Miliband, the shadow climate minister, calling it a “moral responsibility”."

 China France File photo: cnsphoto

As French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Stéphane Séjourné will kick off a visit to China on Monday, Chinese experts said on Sunday that economic and trade relations are the cornerstone of China-France bilateral ties, and the two countries have broad cooperation prospects in green development and technology innovation.

This type of bilateral cooperation has set a good example for the EU by adhering to the principle of mutual benefit and addressing differences through dialogue and consultation, experts said.

On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced that Séjourné will pay a visit to China on Monday at the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi.

During Séjourné's visit, the two countries are expected to focus on bilateral economic and trade relations, solving problems encountered in cooperation, and creating a better business environment for enterprises of both sides, Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday.

In addition, they may strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs and jointly address global challenges such as climate change and public health, Cong noted.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. France will be the guest country of honor at the China International Fair for Trade in Services 2024 and the seventh China International Import Expo.

Over the past six decades, the two countries have adhered to mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, with economic and trade cooperation becoming increasingly closer, experts noted.

""China and France eye faster growth in traditional areas including agricultural products, aviation and civilian nuclear power,"" Cong said.

Under the mechanism ""from French farms to Chinese tables,"" the two countries have reaped fruitful achievements in agricultural products.

As an important source of China's agricultural and food imports, France is China's top agricultural import market and second-largest agricultural trading partner in the EU.

For many years, France has been the largest supplier of bottled still and sparkling wines to China. According to the China Association for Imports and Export of Wines and Spirits, China's wine imports in 2022 amounted to about $1.43 billion, with an import volume of 335,300 kiloliters, of which three countries - France, Chile and Italy - accounted for nearly 80 percent.

In 2022, France's wine exports to China totaled $661.9 million.

In addition, France was the first Western country to sign an air transportation agreement with China and the first Western country to cooperate with China in civilian nuclear energy, according to new.china.com.

""The digital economy will become an important area of economic and trade cooperation between China and France. The two sides can launch in-depth collaboration in artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other fields,"" Cong said.

The two countries also have extensive room for cooperation in the field of clean energy, and they can jointly develop and promote new-energy technologies to help transform the global energy structure, he noted.

Moreover, cooperation between China and France in the fields of the economy, trade, science and technology has demonstrated the broad prospects and great potential of China-EU cooperation, which has helped to enhance the confidence of both sides in cooperation between China and Europe, Cong said."

 Another day, another fatuous ‘fact’ check from Reuters. This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.

One of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.

 by Xinhua writer Shi Hao

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Over the past three months, Anhui Huasun Energy Co., Ltd. has been racing against time to make solar modules for a gigantic photovoltaic project in China's Xinjiang.

These 1.8-gigawatt modules using advanced heterojunction technology will be installed at a 4-gigawatt solar power plant, which is located on the edge of China's largest desert, the Taklimakan.

""For Chinese companies in the photovoltaic industry more than 20 years ago, raw materials, technologies and markets relied heavily on foreign countries and regions. But now, the tide has totally turned,"" Huasun's chairman Xu Xiaohua said.

In east China's Anhui Province, where Xu's company is based, the photovoltaic industry has snowballed in the past five years. The number of companies in the business with an annual revenue exceeding 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars) rose to 11 in 2023.

The boom, which is also recorded beyond Anhui, is underpinned by China's vigorous efforts to expedite a comprehensive transition to green growth as tasks remain daunting.

China aims to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to around 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030, which means the country must make every effort to increase the ratio by one percentage point annually in the next few years.

""The proportion of coal consumption in China's total energy consumption stood at 55.3 percent in 2023, and thus the potential for green and low-carbon energy transition is great,"" said Li Zheng, director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.

China is already revving up the transition to green energy. Official data released this week showed that the installed capacity of solar power came in at approximately 750 million kilowatts in the first eight months of 2024, rocketing 48.8 percent year on year, and the installed capacity of wind power grew 19.9 percent to some 470 million kilowatts.

Pan Huimin, deputy head of the National Energy Administration's new and renewable energy department, said the rapid development of the new energy sector in recent years resulted from full market competition, a sound business environment, constant tech innovation and a complete industrial chain.

To meet the requirement of exports and foster green industrial and supply chains, Chinese enterprises' demand for clean electricity is experiencing ""explosive growth,"" Pan said in the latest episode of the China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua. The new episode was broadcast Friday.

A key challenge is fully harnessing unstable wind and sunlight and transmitting power to users, often hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.

Last month, users in Beijing started receiving solar and wind power generated in the northwestern province of Gansu after the energy was delivered via extra-high-voltage transmission lines, benefiting Gansu companies in the business and meeting the Chinese capital's demand for green energy.

China unveiled an action plan last month to speed up building a ""new electricity system."" According to the document, Chinese authorities will use advanced power generation, regulation and control technologies to increase the transmission of clean electricity through the grid.

Local governments and enterprises should seize opportunities and vigorously exploit wind and solar power in line with local resources and with the capabilities of the grid to absorb the generated electricity, Pan said. ■"

 FACT CHECK: Did Greta Thunberg Say Saving The Banks Would Save The World?

A video shared on social media purports climate change activist Greta Thunberg said to save the banks in order to save the world.

Verdict: False

This video is missing context. Thunberg was not advocating for banks to “save the world.”

Fact Check:

Thunberg recently pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book festival, BBC reported. The event was sponsored by the company Baillie Gifford and Thunberg refused to appear at the event claiming that Baillie Gifford, “invests heavily in the fossil fuel industry.”

The Facebook post purports Thunberg suggested the way to save the world is to save the banks. The post shared a small clip from an interview with Thunberg in which the audience claps after her alleged statement.

“The money is there if we can save the banks, we can save the world,” she says in the clip. The caption reads, “GRETA – Saying the quiet parts out loud. The only way to save the planet is to save the banks.”

The clip is taken out of context. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image and found the clip stems from a conference called, ‘The Right to a Future’ held by The Intercept.

The interviewer asks Greta about her rebuttal to governments saying fighting climate change is “too expensive.” The full exchange features Thunberg arguing that world governments have enough money to help curb climate change suggesting if there is “enough money to bail out the banks, then there is enough money to help the environment.” (RELATED: Did RFK Jr. Meet With Then-President Trump To Lead A Vaccine Safety Commission?)

 Sweden says enough!

Sweden’s Prosecution Authority is bringing charges against none other than their homegrown eco-hoaxer, Greta Thunberg, for disobeying law enforcement during a climate protest in June.

The 20-year-old is facing potential fines or imprisonment of up to six months.

The charges stem from her involvement in a protest that allegedly led to major traffic disruption in Malmö in June, authorities said.

“The prosecutor has filed charges against a young woman who, on June 19 this year, participated in a climate demonstration which, according to the prosecution, caused disruption to traffic in Malmö,” the statement said. The woman “refused to obey the police command to leave the scene,” it added according to CNN.

While the prosecution authority’s statement did not specifically name Thunberg, a spokesperson for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Annika Collin, confirmed to CNN that the individual referred to in the charges is indeed Greta Thunberg.

“The criminal classification is disobedience to law enforcement. According to the prosecutor, the act was committed with intent,” the prosecution authority’s statement added.

Irma Kjellström, a spokesperson for Ta Tillbaka Framtiden, told CNN that Thunberg was among several young people who participated in blocking the oil tankers.

Kjellström added, “After having blocked the industry which is burning our future, we have now been charged with crime. While charges are being brought against us, the real crime continues inside the gates that we blocked.”

Recently, Greta Thunberg was back in the news after her prediction that the world would end in 2023 was a conspiracy.

On June 21, 2018, she made a bold claim on Twitter, stating that humanity had a narrow five-year window to stop the use of fossil fuels or face inevitable extinction.

“A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.”

Thunberg shared a now-deleted Grit Post article by Scott Alden citing a prediction from James Anderson, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University, titled, “Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don’t Fix Climate Change by 2023.”"

Waste recovery is necessary to reduce the increasing quantity of landfill and other forms of rubbish dumping.

Garbage can be transformed into fuel, wood, compost and other materials. Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.

The Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre (RCERO Ljubljana) is the biggest environmental project in Slovenia, and the most modern facility for waste treatment in Europe.

It is also Slovenia’s biggest cohesion fund environmental project, and a great example of regional cooperation.

Euronews’ Aurora Velez spoke with RCERO Ljubljana’s Founder and Head of Investments and Development, Mjtja Praznik, who created, designed and founded the centre from scratch.

Euronews: How did you come up with the idea for the project?

Mjtja Praznik: Some of the activities started in 2000 when Slovenia was joining the EU: we had to adopt a lot of legislative changes in the field of waste management. Up to that time, most of the municipal waste was thrown into landfill. And this, according to new legislation, needed to stop.

So we thought we needed to treat waste: first, separate it, and then use it for material recycling and energy recovery.

Euronews: What is - according to you- the impact of the project in Slovenia and in Europe?

Mjtja Praznik: Slovenia was treating its municipal waste mainly by landfill, losing all the materials and all the energy. By changing the principle, and by introducing this new treatment for waste, the rate of material being recycled has considerably improved.

We have also replaced some combustibles and energies from the fuel produced in the waste and, last but not least, we have also significantly reduced the amount of waste that is going into landfill. From the new plant, only 2% of the waste goes there: the other 98% is transformed into fuel!

Euronews: How do you feel about having created the project from scratch?

Mjtja Praznik: I am very proud of this project. I had the idea 20 years ago and had started researching the technology then.

I am happy that we were able to use our previous experience from landfill, gas extraction and utilisation. All this knowledge has been key to the project. We have aerobic treatment, anaerobic treatment, mechanical treatment: these are all my babies!

I started with it, and I went through all these phases: preparing, studying, comparing different technologies. And lastly, opting for the finance from the European Commission, because the project was not cheap!

Then it took around three and a half years to get the project ready for operation. I'm happy that it was a long project because it is a big one that can't be done overnight.

EN_CC_100122.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Your Connection to Nature 

 I grew up in New England, on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River. We lived in a quiet town with a village green, a local dairy around the corner, and houses lining Main Street that were built in the mid-1700s.

Unlike the deep snows that blanket Vermont in the winter, we lived farther south, in an area known for legendary ice storms. It’s like the weather can’t make up its mind whether to rain or snow, so it rains—then decides to freeze.

When I was in high school, we had the mother of all ice storms. The frozen rain had left almost half an inch of ice on everything from roads and rooftops to the tiniest of twigs. The trees, unable to bear the weight of so much ice, lost branches or were ripped from the ground completely. The branches and felled trees blocked roads and pulled down power lines. We huddled in front of our fireplace, making meals on a camp stove for the better part of a week, without power or heat.

The ice clung stayed for several days. And then one evening, the mercury climbed from below-freezing to 50 degrees in a matter of hours. My dad and I went outdoors to watch the weather change, and because we lived on a hill, we could see what was happening across much of the Connecticut River Valley.

As the thermometer rapidly rose, the tons of ice began falling from the trees and rooftops with a deafening roar. The broken power lines thawed and then lit up the sky with dangerous blue explosions of electricity.

Dad and I watched in wonder as our frozen, ice-caked world thawed. He turned to me and said, “You’ll never forget this night for as long as you live.”

My dad has been gone now for almost two decades, but that evening, his comment, is how I like to remember him. The awe of Mother Nature was unforgettable. But it was also that my dad, a slide-rule-carrying engineer would fearlessly turn to his then-snotty teen-aged daughter and express his amazement and wonder of the world. That’s what I remember most.*

I choose to remember that evening, that moment in time when I think about my dad because it makes me smile. But it was also a profound moment because my father, who was a deeply religious man, was tacitly acknowledging that our connection with nature is also about our relationship with God or the universe or however you define the divine.

The point is that when you stop, observe, and admire the incredible operating system that is nature, how can you be anything but in awe? Nature has the ability to turn a tiny seed into a tree or an ear of corn, just by adding air, water, and sunlight. It keeps the oceans just the right amount of salinity to sustain the lives of fish and other aquatic animals. Our planet provides millions of species of plants, animals, and insects everything they need to survive.

And yet, we get caught up in our lives and often lose touch with nature for long periods of time. Long enough for critical habitat to be turned into parking lots and for rainforests to be cut down. Long enough for our air to become toxic, and for the Colorado River to run empty before it reaches the ocean.

I don’t pretend to have any answers, except for the baby step of reexamining your relationship with the natural world. Stop and listen to the birds, notice how moss looks like a tiny forest, wonder at the tenacity of those plants that grow through the cracks in the sidewalk, and be in awe at how trees know to leaf out in the spring. Be the person who picks up a plastic bag blowing in the wind or who walks to your destination when possible, or who introduces native plants in your yard.

Like that moment in a melting ice storm, it’s the small moments, realizations, and actions that can help in sustaining our planet. Renewing your connection with nature combined with inspired action, multiplied by the billions of people on the planet can make a difference."

The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking 

 A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.

Professor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.

But Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:

The natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.

It is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.

Professor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:

Shakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.

Net Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:

This is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.

But it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.

 Glaciers Give the Lie to Global Warming Narrative

According to the Gospel of the Global Warming Hoax, 1850–1910 was the coldest period of the past millennium. Yet glaciers were retreating rapidly. Now that the planet allegedly has a fever, the retreat has slowed dramatically and even reversed:

Our moonbat rulers canceled the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age for failing to comply with climate ideology. But preventing glaciers from growing is more difficult than doctoring the historical record to support climate con man Michael Mann’s spurious hockey stick graph.

Nonetheless, prophet of doom Al Gore shouts that “we could lose our capacity for self-governance” if we don’t surrender still more freedom to Big Government so that it can fix the supposedly broken weather.

 The climate science denying group the Global Warming Policy Foundation has admitted that it shared an “erroneous” temperature dataset to support Lord Lawson’s false claims to the BBC last week that global temperatures aren’t rising.

Three days after Lawson’s BBC interview – which was immediately and widely criticised in the media and by scientists – the climate denial group tweeted out Sunday afternoon that it was “happy to correct the record” and has since removed the tweet after a request to do so by climate scientist Ed Hawkins.

According to the tweets, the graph was originally produced by US meteorologist Ryan Maue, an adjunct scholar of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute co-founded by Charles Koch. It was published by weather forecaster and climate science denier Joe Bastardi. Both Bastardi and Maue work for WeatherBELL Analytics, a private weather consulting firm.

Thanks for acknowledging this Benny. Are you could to delete the original tweet so that this erroneous claim doesn’t spread further?

— Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) August 13, 2017

Indeed. My bias, my mistake.

— GWPF (@thegwpfcom) August 13, 2017

As a number of climate scientists have been quick to point out, Lawson was wrong to claim that the average global temperature has “slightly declined” since 2007. In fact, the global surface temperature over this period has risen, with the three hottest years on record occurring in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

In addition to being a reaction to those debunking the graph’s false and misleading claims, the GWPF’s efforts to distance themselves from the inaccurate data comes one day after neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer featured a story using the same graph with the headline “It’s Colder Now Than When Al Gore Won the Nobel Prize for Kook Theory in 2007”.

 Letters to the Editor: No, Korean BBQ isn’t going away because of L.A.’s new gas law

To the editor: As an Asian American and advocate for healthier, safer communities for all, I was really disappointed by the article, “The end of Korean BBQ in L.A.? What the gas stove ban means for your fave restaurants.”

People in my community freaked out over the headline, re-sharing this misleading article many times on social media. Simply put, the truth is this: Our favorite restaurants will be fine, as the city of Los Angeles’ ban on most gas appliances in new construction does not apply to existing buildings or existing Korean BBQ restaurants. Their kitchens do not have to be altered due to this measure.

I talked to people who re-shared the article online who did not understand this simple truth based on your headline and article.

That said, I appreciated some commentary in the article about the concerns of chefs who are used to cooking with gas and are thinking about opening new restaurants. It is my hope that chefs across L.A. can discover new ways to cook without harmful gas.

The wok was invented thousands of years ago and used without fossil fuels, and today, we have induction cooking, which I can personally attest is a wonderful way to cook without toxic emissions. We’re all in this together, so let’s act now to deliver a healthier future for generations to come.

Jennifer Ho, La Crescenta

..

To the editor: The California Restaurant Assn. is on the wrong side of history in its opposition to all-electric kitchens. Sadly, this is not the first time restaurant associations have opposed public health and safety measures. In fact, restaurant associations once fought smoke-free laws, with funding from Big Tobacco.

To protect public health and reduce climate emissions from gas stoves, our kitchens and homes will need to be upgraded from gas to electric. Thankfully, induction cooking is a superior cooking technology that keeps kitchens cooler and safer. For chefs cooking primarily with woks, there are electric woks.

Climate change and the health dangers of gas are not going away. Instead of ignoring the problem or fighting health-protective solutions, our field must innovate to continue to prepare the dishes we love safely for our families and customers — and the planet.

 The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Special Representative to the Holy See and Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome, Archbishop Ian Ernest has lauded the Church of Pakistan’s efforts to promote interfaith relations in the country as well as initiating action on the environmental challenges in line with the Lambeth Calls for climate action.

Archbishop Ernest arrived in Pakistan on February 2 on a three-day on the invitation of Church of Pakistan’s President Bishop Dr Azad Marshall. During the visit, the senior church leader held various interactions with faith leaders and community members. He also visited Jaranwala to express solidarity with the victims of the August 16, 2023, violent attacks on multiple churches and homes of Christians.

Speaking to a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Saint Peter’s High School of the Diocese of Raiwand, Archbishop Ernest noted the cordial relations between the clergy of the majority Muslim community and leaders of other faiths. He stressed on the need for continued engagement between the various faith groups for promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence in society.

“It’s encouraging to see such good interfaith relations, which can also contribute greatly towards our common goal of protecting our environment,” said Archbishop Ernest.

The visiting dignitary was awarded a shield by Muslim faith leaders, including former special assistant to the prime minister on interfaith harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi.

The archbishop also participated in a special meeting on climate action organised by the moderator bishop of the Church of Pakistan on Feb 4.

Addressing the participants, Archbishop Ernest lauded the Church of Pakistan’s initiative on climate action, saying he was impressed by the realisation in the church for collaborating with ecumenical partners and faith-based institutions to bring about the much-needed change by raising awareness and collective action.

“I think it’s a God given opportunity for us to be able to change the mentality of our people and to bring about the values of the Kingdom where respect for God’s creation and respect for the other are of crucial importance. Without respecting what God has given us so freely, it would be difficult for us to be instruments of grace in the world,” he said.

Earlier, Bishop Marshall briefed the meeting about the church’s initiatives for fostering partnerships to meet the environmental challenges.

He stressed on inculcating the spirit of stewardship, as embodied by the wisdom of the Christian tradition, to change the mindset towards the natural world.

“Though Pakistan is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it is unfortunate that our country is also the least funded to effectively combat the crisis.

“We need to act together to protect, restore and safeguard the environment for ourselves and for our future generations,” he emphasised.

Archbishop Ernest and bishops of all dioceses of the Church of Pakistan also participated in the soft-launch of Bishop Marshall’s book titled “The Calling of Lent” at the Lahore College of Theology.

The messages of Archbishop of Canterbury Rt Revd Justin Welby and Anglican Communion’s Secretary General Rt Revd Bishop Anthony Poggo were also shared on the occasion.

In his message, Archbishop Welby said, “Archbishop Azad has taken considerable care to explore some of the spiritual disciplines which might help people journey more closely with Christ to the Cross and prepare for the celebrations of Easter.”

Bishop Poggo, who has written the foreword of the book, stated: “As you study this book during Lent, do please reflect upon the passion of Jesus. Lent is also a season whereby we acknowledge our need for repentance, mercy and forgiveness which is the essence of the message of Jesus Christ’s suffering on the cross.”"

 ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.

According to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.

Saiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.

She said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.

According to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK."

 European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Andreas Mogensen has captured a new image of a red sprite, a rare type of electrical discharge rarely seen from Earth.

As part of the Thor-Davis experiment, Danish astronaut Mogensen heads to the International Space Station's (ISS) Cupola observatory module every Saturday to attempt to photograph storms from above. In the first image released by the experiment, which aims to study intense thunderstorms from a better vantage point as well as weather phenomena in high altitude, a Transient Luminous Event (TLE) is seen between 40 and 80 kilometers (25-50 miles) above the Earth.

TLEs, sometimes called ""sprites"", ""red sprites"", or ""red jellyfish sprites"", have been reported by pilots for decades, but were only recorded for the first time in July 1989. They are rarely seen from the surface, which is probably for the best, given the illusion they create of an invading alien space force.

Like regular lightning strikes, the sprites occur following a build-up of electrical charge within clouds. With red sprites, however, the discharge occurs into the Earth's mesosphere up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) above the Earth. The eerie red color occurs as the charge meets nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere.

Mogensen captured the sprite with an ""event camera"", which according to ESA works more like a human eye than a regular camera, sensing changes in contrast rather than capturing an image. An advantage of these cameras is they can produce around 100,000 images a second, while drawing very little power to do so. Among other aims, the study strives to better understand how lightning in the upper atmosphere affects the concentration of greenhouse gases.

“These images taken by Andreas are fantastic,"" Olivier Chanrion, lead scientist for this experiment, told ESA of this first image from it. ""The Davis camera works well and gives us the high temporal resolution necessary to capture the quick processes in the lightning."""

 Interview: China's green energy transition inspires countries worldwide: UNDP chief

DUBAI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's green energy transitions will contribute to the global fight against climate change and inspire other countries toward green transition, said Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in a recent interview with Xinhua.

In the interview during the 11th World Governments Summit recently held in Dubai, the UNDP administrator said China's development has been remarkable in so many respects, including poverty alleviation, and its investments in technology and the green transition.

""It is addressing some of the legacies of its rapid industrialization, the air pollution, and the cleaning up of water systems.""

China has made major commitments that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, noted Steiner.

""These transitions will enable China to be both a contributor to a global response to climate change, but also with its technologies and policies will help many other countries including many developing countries to pivot forward into a green transition strategy.""

Also in the interview, Steiner highlighted China as the backbone of the international economic recovery.

His assessment comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global growth to stay at 3.1 percent in 2024 and rise to 3.2 percent in 2025 while forecasting the Chinese economy to expand by 4.6 percent this year.

""The outlook on the global economy is in part also premised on China's own economic development.""

He noted that although there are many factors influencing China's recovery in terms of GDP growth, the Chinese economy is looking positive at the moment and the UNDP remains optimistic that a recovery path is on its way.

UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and exclusion, and build resilience so countries can sustain progress.

As the UN's development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

""We see great potential for our future collaboration in China with the SDGs, including on the SDG innovation hubs that China is establishing and where we are collaborating.""

Asked about his priorities for UNDP in 2024, Steiner said the challenge of climate change remains a centerpiece of UNDP's work.

The 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) is planned to take place in Brazil between Nov. 10 and 21, 2025.

""We are today committed to working with countries across the world towards the Conference of the Parties next year in Brazil, when countries will present their new nationally determined contributions and national climate plans,"" he said."

 China shares inclusive development with the world: Former Director-General of UNESCO

Former Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, receives an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online in Beijing, Sep. 10, 2024. (People's Daily Online/Zhang Wenjie).

China's modernization and inclusive development have helped 1.4 billion Chinese people, set examples, and shared experiences with other countries, benefiting the world as a whole, said Irina Bokova, former Director-General of UNESCO.

Bokova, who is also the Honorary Dean of the School of International Organizations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, visited China several times and voiced her appreciation for China's rapid progress over the last several decades, stating that China's tremendous economic, social, and technological advancements have contributed significantly to the experience of the globe. She also noted that through cooperation mechanisms such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is fulfilling its obligation to share its inclusive growth with other countries.

""UNESCO and China have together developed many joint activities, partnerships and initiatives, among my most memorable moments was President Xi Jinping's visit to UNESCO a decade ago,"" Bokova told People's Daily Online during an exclusive interview.

In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, laying out his vision of civilization that features diversity, equality and inclusiveness.

""We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace,"" President Xi said.

""President Xi's speech about diversity is very important, it shows that though we belong to different cultures, we are all members of one shared community,"" said Bokova.

According to Bokova, China is fulfilling its responsibility to share its success with the rest of the world by promoting collaboration and inclusive development. For example, China was the first developing country to realize one of the UN Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, making a significant contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause.

""China's commitment, inclusive development, and strong leadership demonstrate to the world that equality and inclusion in society are attainable. This benefits not only the Chinese people, but also other countries around the world,"" added Bokova.

Bokova has also praised China's ""new quality productive forces"". With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces are forces that feature advanced productivity and are free from traditional economic growth modes and productivity development paths. They are defined by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality, and are in line with the new development philosophy.

""It is a very interesting and innovative concept China is taking. I think it is justified because the world and global economy are entering a new phase, and it is critical to use innovation and technology to encourage young people to use all of the potential of science to achieve equality and social inclusion, as well as to address challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss,"" said Bokova, adding that ""new quality productive forces"" have the potential to reconcile humans with nature while maintaining all of the benefits of technological progress.

 total of 58 villages across the archipelago are harnessing renewable energy to stimulate economic and social activities in their communities through the Village Energy Independence (DEB) program under Pertamina’s Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSER) umbrella.

The DEB program has expanded as of September to another 11 sites, six of these powered through solar power plants (SPPs) that were installed in collaboration with Pertamina New & Renewable Energy (PNRE), a subsidiary that specializes in new and renewable energy.

The six new DEB locations are: Singapure village in Lahat regency, South Sumatra; Tambakharjo subdistrict in Semarang, Central Java; Eka Jaya subdistrict in Jambi province; Tasikharjo district in Tuban regency, East Java; Larangan village in Cirebon, West Java; and Adat Kedonganan village in Badung, Bali. In addition to infrastructure development, the DEB program also empowers communities in accelerating energy equity by utilizing local energy sources to deliver power to remote villages.

Pertamina vice president corporate communication Fadjar Djoko Santoso said Pertamina would continue to provide access to renewables for all Indonesians so they ultimately achieved energy and economic self-reliance.

""We are continuing our journey to provide opportunities and accelerate the energy transition for the public, such as through the DEB program, which can be beneficial in stimulating economic activity,"" Fadjar said.

Tasikharjo village is one tangible example of Pertamina’s support for local economies through the DEB program. The village is using solar energy to power local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as Batik Sekar Tanjung, Jahit Sekar Tanjung and Ethical Creative Tasikharjo.

Meanwhile, Tambakharjo subdistrict is using solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the activities of the Pujasera Energy Culinary Kampung.

Solar energy is also being harnessed to support a variety of activities in Kedonganan village that impact the region’s community-based economy, including the operation of its reduce, reuse, recycle waste management facility (TPS3R).

Solar PV panels is also used to generate renewable energy in the villages of Eka Jaya, Larangan and Singapure to support the activities of aquaponics, aquaculture and agriculture MSMEs, including a coffee farm, as well as other MSMEs that stimulate economic and social development.

""The use of renewable and environmentally friendly energy, which never runs out, greatly enhances the productivity of coffee bean processing and other business production, early childhood schools and other public institutions, such as Posyandu [integrated health services posts],” said Singapure village head Aristo Hasan.

“This improves the quality of life for residents of Singapure village and also broadens our understanding of environmentally friendly, renewable energy that can help the government mitigate climate change,"" Aristo added.

Since Pertamina launched the DEB program in 2019, the program has generated benefits that include 170,880 watt-peak (Wp) of solar energy, 605,000 cubic meters per year of biogas and methane, 8,000 Wp of microhydropower, 6,500 liters of biodiesel per year and 16,500 Wp of solar-wind hybrid energy.

In addition to its energy impact, the DEB program has also positively impacted 3,201 households, contributing to an estimate of Rp 1.8 billion in added value per year through overall multiplier effect. The program has also contributed to reducing carbon emissions by 565,928 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per year.

As part of Pertamina’s CSER initiative, the DEB program supports the company's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles. The program is also in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in achieving SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 13 on Climate Action.

Moreover, the DEB program is a concrete action Pertamina is taking to contribute to the government's 2060 net zero emissions goal.

 BAKU, Azerbaijan, April 23. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country taking part in solving global environmental problems, editor of London-based Energy Intelligence Michael Ritchie told Trend.

""During COP29 in November, all eyes will be on Azerbaijan. The event will be attended by tens of thousands of journalists, participants, and delegates. There will also be questions about why the oil and gas producer is taking part in the climate talks. But COP29 follows immediately after this conference in the United Arab Emirates, also a major oil and gas producer. The UK, where I come from, is also an oil and gas producer and has also hosted this conference. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country that is taking part in solving global environmental problems,"" Ritchie said.

According to him, COP29 is crucial to achieve financial goals and to obtain additional funds, possibly from developed countries, for climate finance. It will also lay the groundwork for the next COP30 in Brazil.

To note, Azerbaijan will host the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in November this year. The decision was made at the plenary meeting of COP28 held in Dubai on December 11 last year. Within two weeks, Baku, having become the center of the world, will host about 70,000–80,000 foreign guests.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is an agreement signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992 to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate system. The acronym COP (Conference of Parties) stands for Conference of Parties, which is the highest legislative body overseeing the implementation of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The parties to the convention are 198 countries. Unless the parties have decided otherwise, COP is held annually. The first COP event was held in March 1995 in Germany's Berlin, and its secretariat is located in Bonn.

 As the world is becoming more and more aware about the dangers of climate change, various countries are trying to embrace the green energy. China is among those nations that are serious about using renewable sources of energy. Norwegian diplomat and former politician, Erik Solheim recently informed via his Twitter handle that the photovoltaic (PV) power plants of China increased their production capacity to 392.61 GW in 2022. Solheim added that the China’s export of PV products grew by 80 per cent to $51.3 billion, and nearly 46 per cent of it went to Europe. He also shared a video clip where hundreds of solar panels can be seen in a solar park.

Wang Bohua, honorary chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, said that China’s export of solar product exceeded $50 billion for the first time last year, as mentioned in a report by Yicai Global. The export comprised panels worth $42.4 billion, silicon wafers of value $5.1 billion, and batteries amounting to $3.8 billion.

Among the main PV products, the polysilicon production of China jumped 63 per cent to 827,000 tons last year, according to Wang. Wang added that the cell production increased 61 per cent to 318 GW, while panel and wafer production increased by 59 per cent and 58 per cent to 288.7 GW and 357 GW, respectively.

In a recent development, US imports of solar panels have begun to pick up after months of gridlock stemming from the implementation of a new law that bans goods produced with forced labour, as told by two Chinese solar companies to Reuters. A White House official attributed the thaw in shipments to clearer rules for complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).

The gains come as a relief to major Chinese suppliers like Trina Solar and Jinko Solar. These suppliers are now finally getting products into the lucrative market of United States after long delays. Under the labour protection law, imports of products made in China’s Xinjiang region are prohibited. Chinese authorities have reportedly established labour camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups in the Xinjiang region."

 When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?

Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8, The Associated Press reported. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.

“To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.

While there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.

Seven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, “that generally do absolutely nothing all day ... during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,” said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.

A mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in “apparent anxiety.” The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.

Researchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk.

In April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.

Several other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.

This year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.

“It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,"" said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.

The honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.

“During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,” said University of Alberta's Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.

Nate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that “solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,” when skies darken and many animals take shelter.

After the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, “probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.”

The last full US solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.

Most songbird species migrate at night. “When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?” said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.

His team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.

As for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.

The BRI has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- ""On the ten years anniversary we can declare the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) an amazingly successful initiative"", said Erik Solheim, chairman of the Europe-Asia Center, former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Commending the pioneering role of the initiative in promoting employment and alleviating poverty, Solheim said, ""Nearly 150 countries take part in the BRI and benefit from the investments, trade, technology transfer and people to people contact with China.""

Solheim, former Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, highly appreciated the accomplishments of the initiative in advancing sustainable development.

""China has defeated air and water pollution much faster than any other nation,"" he said, referring to China's Zhejiang province as a world leader in river conservation, and the cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shenzhen as among the world's greenest cities. ""This gives China enormous strength in sharing experiences with other nations.""

The BRI, he said, has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

Solheim also spoke positively of China's decision to stop building coal plants overseas, which ""coincide with similar developments in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kenya and many other nations along the BRI.""

""The BRI is progressively greener, with a massive focus on solar, wind, hydro and green transport. In the future, it will be the world's number one vehicle for green investments,"" he said.

Solheim emphasized the need for increased cooperation between Europe and China, which is ""critical for environment protection, global economic development and world peace.""

He criticized the ""de-risking"" narrative as ""decoupling"" in essence, which is ""a stupid and dangerous way of scoring own goals."" Both de-risking and decoupling will lead to impoverishment and escalate the likelihood of conflict, he said.

""We need to find the right balance between competition and cooperation. This demands a strong and open dialogue between Europe and China,"" said the environmental protection expert."

Getty Center, one of the top attractions in the U.S. West Coast city of Los Angeles, celebrated the annual Indigenous Peoples' Day over the weekend with an expansive family event aimed at highlighting both traditional and contemporary Indigenous perspectives.

The gathering on Saturday was part of Getty's continuous efforts to celebrate Southern California's vibrant Native American cultures. Sitting atop a hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Getty Center, a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust, took around 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to build and opened in December 1997. It is well known for its architecture, gardens, and bird's-eye views of Los Angeles.

Building on last year's success, where attendees learned about native plant dyes and relished musical performances, this year's event in the museum had a broader scope.

Generous support for this year's celebration came from the Getty Patron Program, which provides funds for exceptional exhibitions at the museum, reflecting the institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Los Angeles stands on indigenous land. Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day is not just about acknowledgment but about understanding, appreciating, and cherishing the cultures that have been here for thousands of years,"" former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell remarked previously. O'Farrell was the first Native American to serve on the Los Angeles's City Council from 2013 to 2022.

Indigenous Peoples' Day is recognized on the second Monday of October, and its significance has grown over the years as an alternative to Columbus Day.

Rita, a teacher from Compton with Native American ancestry, attended the event with her family. ""It's essential for my children to see their culture celebrated so publicly. This is an educational experience, a cultural revival, and a family day out, all rolled into one.""

All-day activities included a tasting menu curated by culinary anthropologist Claudia Serrato, which offered attendees a chance to savor traditional Mesoamerican flavors like cacao, chia seeds, maíz, and amaranth. Participants also received recipe cards to recreate these delicacies at home.

Luna, inspired by the Alliance of Native American Chefs, attended the tasting event with an eye to learning more ways to develop her own brand of Native American cuisine that fuses her grandmother's cooking with modern flavors.

""I want to celebrate my amazing grandmother, of the Aqua Caliente tribe, who could do wonders with simple traditional ingredients, and encourage others to explore our unique culinary traditions,"" she told Xinhua.

The celebration further comprised a block stamp workshop led by Meztli Projects, where attendees learned about Mexica lifeways using linocut stamps.

""As someone deeply involved in the revival of indigenous arts, this event is a significant step forward,"" stated Carlos Red Feather, an artist from the Pacific Northwest. ""It's not just about the past; it's about the present and future of our art and our communities.""

""I've been attending these celebrations for years, and the shift in narrative is palpable,"" Linda M., a Native American LA resident, told Xinhua. ""We appreciate the efforts of California's leaders to ensure that our voices are heard, our histories acknowledged, and our rights secured.""

The event's broader intent was evident as it also shone light on the pressing challenges faced by Indigenous communities, such as discrimination, disproportionate impacts of climate change, and land rights.

Conversations echoed sentiments expressed by leaders like Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who emphasized that the community is not merely a historical footnote but remains a crucial and vibrant part of the American fabric.

As the day ended, Mirim S., a student from the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected that ""today was more than a celebration. It was a call to action. We, the younger generation must ensure that the message of diversity and recognition is not confined to a single date but is carried on through our daily lives.""

As Los Angeles and other cities in California and across the United States continue to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, attendees expressed the hope that it would pave the way for greater understanding, recognition and collaboration in the future."

France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou and ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif call on donors and the private sector to urgently provide a total of US$1.5 billion.

NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2023 At this weekend’s Global Citizen Festival in New York, France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, and Education Cannot Wait Executive Director Yasmine Sherif announced €40 million in new, additional funding from the Government of France.

Education Cannot Wait (ECW) has now mobilized US$870 million toward its 2023-2026 Strategic Plan to reach 20 million crisis-impacted children with the safety, hope and opportunity of a quality education.

“Championing global education and emancipation is an absolute priority for France. The message of the Paris Pact for People and the Planet is that we must all take our part to allow each country to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change,” said France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. “This includes states, which must support development policies with sufficient resources. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to announce, on behalf of France and President Macron, the allocation of €40 million to support ECW’s actions for the 2023-2026 cycle.”

“With this new bold and generous contribution, France shines as an example for others to follow,” said ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif. “We call on government donors, philanthropic foundations, and the private sector to follow suit and join our collective efforts to mobilize a total of US$1.5 billion by 2026 to provide quality education to 20 million crisis-affected girls and boys so they can learn, grow and rebuild their societies.”

Globally, around 224 million children are deprived of a quality education due to armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and other protracted crises. They need urgent support to fulfil their right to a quality, inclusive education.

Together with strategic partners, ECW has already reached close to 9 million girls and boys in some of the harshest crises around the globe.

While donors are stepping up, the funding gap has actually widened in recent years. Humanitarian appeals for education in emergencies have nearly tripled from US$1.1 billion in 2019 to almost US$3 billion at the end of 2022."

 Letters to the Editor: Offshore wind can be California’s next Gold Rush

To the editor: Just as the Pacific was critical in transporting miners in the rush for gold and has been key to our state’s and our nation’s epic transoceanic commerce, it can now usher in our next Gold Rush in the form of offshore wind power.

Kudos to Michelle Solomon and Taylor McNair for reminding readers that this form of clean, renewable energy blowing along our coast needs only to be harnessed with floating wind turbines and transmitted via infrastructure to our population centers, facilitated by Inflation Reduction Act financial incentives.

The technology is available, the seed money to pay for the launch of this promising enterprise exists and the need for offshore wind energy could not be greater as the climate crisis ravages much of the world.

Gov. Newsom, this is your summons to even bolder climate leadership.

Ginger Osborne, Laguna Beach

..

To the editor: California stands to benefit from cleaner air, good-paying jobs and reliable energy with offshore wind technology. But policymakers need to pass legislation that locks in investment and resources for offshore wind to ultimately succeed in our state.

California should start by ensuring a market exists for the clean power that offshore wind will create. To do that, the Legislature should pass AB 1373. This piece of legislation ensures central procurement for offshore wind, meaning the Public Utilities Commission will start requiring utilities and companies servicing Californians’ electrical needs to have a diverse portfolio of clean energy sources — including offshore wind.

Lawmakers need to kick-start offshore wind in California, and they can start by passing AB 1373.

Dan Jacobson, Elk Grove, Calif.

..

To the editor: I agree that California should become a leader in building and deploying floating wind turbines. And while we can help this “nascent” technology emerge, we shouldn’t wait for it to mature to deploy offshore wind.

There are many unsightly oil platforms not far off the coast, particularly in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. These are grounded. We should deploy grounded wind turbines at similar depths and distances.

EN_CC_100235.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Mitigating climate change brings economic benefits 

 Editor's note: Jin Jun is an associate professor at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Mitigating climate change fosters a cooperative and symbiotic relationship between carbon neutrality, sustainable economic and social development, which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.

On the one hand, actions to mitigate climate change and improve the ecological environment can yield direct and indirect economic benefits for socio-economic development. Green and sustainable development can propel the growth of society, from enterprises and businesses to regions and whole nations.

(1) New innovative entrepreneurial opportunities and job positions emerge in response to the need to slow climate change. Innovative entrepreneurship opportunities and employment positions related to carbon neutrality continue to sprout up. For example, as ""carbon"" becomes a strategic asset, enterprises have a substantial demand for professionals in carbon accounting and management, resulting in a surge of new job positions. Relevant technologies and market applications also attract a multitude of innovators and entrepreneurs.

(2) The industrial revolution is evident during the process of mitigating climate change, as emerging industries rapidly develop and gradually replace existing ones. For instance, the swift development of the new energy industry and its supporting sectors in recent years has driven the development of the energy storage industry. Additionally, new energy vehicles are gradually replacing traditional fuel ones, leading to changes in the competition landscape and core technologies of the automotive industry. The application of digital and intelligent technology aids the manufacturing industry in achieving the goal of green transition and carbon neutrality, contributing to the high-end transformation of industries and enterprises.

(3) Emerging strategic resources become crucial for enterprises to attract investment and financing. Green initiatives have become a resource for enterprises to attract investment and financing. ESG(environment, social and governance) ratings have become a crucial indicator of whether companies can obtain financing and loans. Carbon trading will also bring companies new revenue sources. Resources like sunlight, water, and wind have evolved into crucial resource endowments for enterprises and countries. Countries and regions abundant in these new and crucial strategic resources will witness shifts in their domestic and international influences.

(4) Demonstration of international competitiveness and industry leadership is linked to the capacity for green innovation and the ability to achieve carbon neutrality. These factors influence the proactiveness and competitiveness of various organizations and countries in global business activities and international business affairs, as well as their international image and market reputation. These capabilities have become essential tools and means to address regional crises. Companies like CATL and BYD have become industry leaders in the global new energy market. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the sustainable environmental and social development of regions including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, facilitating their development and growth in these regions. Meanwhile, the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for example, demonstrates that the ability to reduce carbon emissions will affect enterprises’ import and export costs and international competitiveness.

(5) Improved quality of life for people is a result of environmental protection and improvement, which reduces the adverse impact of harsh environments on health. This, in turn, lowers the demand for medical resources and elevates the overall quality of life, indirectly accelerating socio-economic development.

On the other hand, socio-economic development further promotes innovative entrepreneurial activities that mitigate climate change. Market-driven technological applications propel the iterative upgrading of green technologies, thus driving overall technological innovation. When people benefit from improved ecological environments, they become more receptive to related technologies and innovations, thereby propelling the development of related technological innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, when companies benefit from improvements in the ecological environment, they enhance their competitiveness and innovative capacity, boosting their ability to innovate related technologies and undertake entrepreneurial activities.

Therefore, the improvement of the ecological environment through mitigating climate change and the green and sustainable development of businesses are mutually influential and complementary, often leading to their coordinated development."

 BRAZZAVILLE, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President William Ruto said on Saturday that Kenya will lift visa requirements for all Africans by the end of 2023 with the aim of boosting trade with African countries.

""By the end of this year, no African will need a visa to enter Kenya. The time has come to understand the importance of doing trade between us,"" said Ruto, while speaking at the summit of the world's three major forest basins, namely the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong Forest Basins, in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo.

Ruto noted the low rate of intra-African trade and urged to reduce customs tariffs within the African continent to accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

""It is time we realize the importance of trading among ourselves and allowing goods, services, people and ideas to move freely across the continent,"" he said, adding that trade among East African Community countries had grown significantly due to the removal of visa requirements and tariffs.

Ruto said that acknowledging and providing incentives to countries in tropical forest basins for forest protection is a smart climate action.

The Amazon basin in South America, the Congo basin in Central Africa, and the Borneo-Mekong basin in Southeast Asia collectively constitute 80 percent of the world's rainforests and contain approximately two-thirds of its biodiversity. These rainforests are not only vital for their local ecosystems but also play a global role in regulating the planet's climate and sustaining life on Earth."

 Climate change protesters have been arrested in Melbourne, Victoria after they staged another blockade, this time at the busy Flinders Street Station.

Over 30 climate activists refused to move off the road at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets on March 16. This followed a protest of hundreds of activists who marched from Treasury Gardens to Flinders Street Station in the city later in the afternoon.

The activists were heard yelling, “People power, power to the people,” and, “This is civil disobedience in action.”

“Doing it for the kids I love,” and, “Climate crisis,” were among the signs and banners waved by the group of protesters.

“Free Palestine” signs were also seen among the climate emergency signs displayed on Melbourne streets.

Meanwhile, police arrested 32 people who remained on the runway, and 27 of them will be charged on summons with obstruction of the road.

Police had warned rally organisers who wanted to avoid arrest to leave the intersection, The Age reported.

A spokesperson for Victorian Police told The Epoch Times they attended the planned rally and say about 300 people were there.

“A number of protesters remained at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets after being told to move on by police,” the police said. “32 protesters remained on the roadway and were subsequently arrested. 27 of those protesters will be charged on summons with obstruction of a road.

“Five of those protesters needed to be carried from the roadway by police, four will be charged with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker, and summary hinder police, and bailed to Melbourne Magistrates Court. One will be charged on summons with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker and summary hinder police.”

Extinction Rebellion Victoria posted multiple videos showing footage of the event on March 17.

Multiple Protests Throughout the WeekDuring the week, Extinction Rebellion held multiple “disrupt the city” protests in the city.

“We rebel on the unceded lands of the peoples of the Kulin Nation. Always was, always will be,” the group claimed.

Police were forced to move activists to the footpath on March 13 after they allegedly blocked traffic on LaTrobe and Bourke Streets.

“We are non-violent protesters—we would never resort to violence because we creating the world that we want to see.”

However, the Victorian Police said they respect the right to peacefully protest.

Incident Follows Perth Climate ProtestIn late February, a climate change activist was arrested, and multiple others were issued move-on notices, at a protest against a major Woodside gas project.

The activists were seen holding signs including “oil and gas collapse,” “climate action now,” and “Woodside ecocide blood on your hands,” gathered outside the company’s headquarters in Perth.

Police were seen placing handcuffs on an individual on the road in front of the company’s building on Feb. 20.

This rally was timed to coincide with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese travelling to Perth for three days to discuss the economy, cost of living, and housing at a Federal Cabinet meeting.

Commenting on the incident, a police spokesperson confirmed with The Epoch Times that one person had been charged with obstructing the carriageway.

The individual received a summons to appear in court at a later date. Five move-on notices were also delivered by the police."

 Eight states — California, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington — and the District of Columbia are now on board with plans to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles within the next decade.

The plans to phase out the vehicles and switch to electric and hybrid vehicles come as the Biden administration continues to pursue its lofty climate goals in a struggling economy. The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.

All 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.

California was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.

According to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s “growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.”

As noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.

The EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.

President Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.


The new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.

For example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both “reckless” and “ill-informed.”

“The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,” the senator said. “This reckless and ill-informed rule will impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs.”"

 We have seen, time and again, the hypocrisy of the extreme environmental movement, especially the climate-change wing of this movement — most of whom don't live anywhere near the actual environment. From Al Gore's mansion to John Kerry's private jets to Leonardo DiCaprio's mega-yacht, these people are all really big on ""Do as we say, not as we do.""

And it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.

This brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.

Swathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.

Across the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.

Rows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.

Indonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.

But demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.

Guess who is, in large part, funding all this?

Billion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.

In just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.

Granted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.

It's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.

That's always been the whole problem with these people; they never count the cost, all the costs, of the agenda for which they advocate. They are of a kind with (and in many cases are the same people) who complain about, say, my going into the woods to shoot a grouse or a snowshoe hare for supper, demanding to know why I can't get my meat at a grocery store so no animal has to die. They are of a kind with the ""Stop Oil"" protesters who block traffic for hours, forcing people to sit with their car engines idling, pouring still more exhaust into the air. They are of a kind with the Greta Thunbergs of the world, ill-informed scolds who want to dictate the end of our modern, technological lifestyles.

They never figure situations like the mining of nickel for EV batteries in Indonesia into their calculus, any more than they account for the mining of cobalt with slave labor in Congo, or mining for lithium and its accompanying environmental disturbance.

To put it bluntly, they are hypocrites of the worst sort. Why do they ignore these problems with their policies? Is it just because these particular environments are far away and out of sight of these mostly affluent, mostly Western activists?

Or are they just ignorant?

 West silences activists at home while promoting rights abroad – report

Democratic governments suppress protests at home but preach human rights abroad, Climate Rights International has said

Rich democratic nations are deploying harsh measures against climate change activists, while criticizing states in the Global South for similar actions, according to a report by Climate Rights International.

The report highlights the increasingly “heavy-handed treatment” of eco activists in Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK, and the US, emphasizing that authorities in those nations are violating their legal commitments to protect basic human rights.

According to the study, the drastic steps taken by governments in nations perceived as democratic include lengthy prison terms, preventive detention, and intimidation and harassment online and in the media.

The 70-page report entitled “On Thin Ice: Disproportionate Responses to Climate Change Protesters in Democratic Countries” also highlights how such governments criticize authorities in developing nations for not respecting the right to peaceful protest.

“Governments too often take such a strong and principled view about the right to peaceful protest in other countries – but when they don’t like certain kinds of protests at home they pass laws and deploy the police to stop them,” the executive director of Climate Rights International, Brad Adams, told The Guardian.

Judicial authorities in several countries including the UK, Germany and the US have been imposing “record-breaking” sentences for “non-violent protest,” the report said, emphasizing that some national and state governments are using preemptive arrests and detention of those suspected of planning rallies.

Governments in Western states are also adopting new laws to make the vast majority of protests illegal, and allowing more severe penalties for demonstrators, the report noted.

The researchers accused Western authorities of undermining the right to a fair trial by taking legal steps to stop juries from hearing about people’s motives for taking part in protests during court hearings.

In one UK case in July, five Just Stop Oil protesters were convicted of conspiracy to cause public nuisance by blocking a highway, and were handed the longest-ever sentences for a nonviolent protest. One of the group received a five-year sentence, while four others received four-year terms."

 President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.

The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.

Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.

The final rules -- which were described by administration official as ""the strongest ever"" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.

The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.

Biden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.

""I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,"" said Biden in a statement. ""Together, we've made historic progress.""

Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.""

- Industry given more time -

EVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.

The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.

Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.

Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a ""variety of pathways"" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.

This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.

Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.

Moderating the targets in these first three years ""was the right call,"" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.

""These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,"" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.

- Too many 'loopholes'? -

The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.

Wednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules ""take us in the right direction,"" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.

But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as ""significantly weaker.""

""The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,"" Becker said.

""The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics."""

 Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week announced his intent to spend $500 million on a campaign to replace coal plants and prevent the construction of new natural gas plants in favor of renewable energy sources.

The Washington Examiner noted that this $500 million, along with the $500 million Bloomberg previously gave to the ""Beyond Carbon"" campaign, make it one of the largest philanthropic efforts involving climate change ever.

""By working with our partners across the country, we hope to transform the way we power America by moving beyond fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy,"" Bloomberg, a United Nations special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, said during the U.N. Global Assembly in New York on Wednesday.

In a press release, the former mayor's organization Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that it has helped to retire more than two-thirds of all the coal plants in the United States. The group is also helping to fund several environmentalist groups in the country, including Sierra Club, Earthjustice, and the League of Conservation Voters.

Chris Jahn, chief executive of the American Chemistry Council, hit out at the announcement in a statement to The New York Times.

""Attempts to shut down American chemical manufacturing are a bet against millions of hard-working men and women in our industry,"" Jahn said, adding that this program ""would send essential jobs overseas and threaten America's leadership to innovate and compete with countries like China."""

Just as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people’s meat with new plans to save the world from “climate change” by forcing everyone to become a “plant-based” vegetarian or vegan.

Along with representatives from the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new “carbon footprint” and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple’s “carbon emissions” by 33 percent by the year 2030.


In order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new “caps on meat” that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions – and eventually within their own homes as well.

(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)

Eric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans

At a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City’s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.

With the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.

Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.

While the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.

“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”

“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”

Other than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”

“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”

The simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.

“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”"

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

The Danish government has introduced radical new laws that will tax livestock farmers for “emissions” from cows, pigs, and sheep to supposedly “fight global warming.”

Demark has become the first country in the world to introduce a carbon tax that seeks to force farmers to comply with the goals of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) “Net Zero” agenda.

The Scandinavian nation will tax farmers for the so-called “greenhouse gases” allegedly emitted by their livestock from 2030.


Denmark’s globalist leaders claim they are targeting a major source of methane emissions, which they allege is one of the most potent gases contributing to “global warming.”

In order to comply with the WEF’s “Net Zero” targets, Taxation Minister Jeppe Bruus said the aim is to reduce Danish “greenhouse gas emissions” by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030.

As of 2030, Danish livestock farmers will be taxed $43 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.

The tax will increase to $108 by 2035.

However, because of an income tax deduction of 60%, the actual cost per ton will start at $17.3 and increase to $28 by 2035.

Although carbon dioxide is typically blamed for causing “climate change,” globalists claim that methane traps about 87 times more heat on a 20-year timescale.

However, as Slay News has previously reported, top scientists have debunked these claims as a hoax.

A recent peer-reviewed study provided conclusive scientific evidence proving that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Earth’s atmosphere cannot cause “global warming.”

Dr. Jan Kubicki led a group of world-renowned Polish scientists to study the impact of increases in CO2 emissions on the Earth’s global temperatures.

However, not only did they find that higher levels of CO2 made no difference, but they also proved that it simply isn’t possible for increases in carbon dioxide to cause temperatures to rise.

Kubicki and his team recently published three papers which all conclude that Earth’s atmosphere is already “saturated” with carbon dioxide.

This saturation means that, even at greatly increased levels of CO2, the “greenhouse gas” will not cause temperatures to rise.

Nevertheless, unelected globalists at the United Nations Environment Program claim that livestock accounts for about 32% of “human-caused methane emissions.”

“We will take a big step closer in becoming climate neutral in 2045,” Bruus said."

 Eastern African parliamentarians on Thursday agreed to champion the cause for swift and determined climate action from governments and relevant organizations to avert food crises and malnutrition in the sub-region.

""The Eastern Africa sub-region is particularly vulnerable, experiencing cascading effects on food security, nutrition, poverty, and livelihoods. Climate change leads to a breakdown of food systems, resulting in loss of rural livelihoods, income, and ecosystems,"" said the Eastern Africa Parliamentary Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in a joint statement issued in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, after attending the fifth general assembly meeting organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The meeting discussed current legal and policy issues and gaps related to climate action and food systems transformation in the sub-region, as well as opportunities and priority actions, including policy options and financing mechanisms, to advance this crucial agenda in Eastern Africa.

Some 22 million children under the age of 5 years are stunted in eastern Africa, according to FAO. /CFP

Some 22 million children under the age of 5 years are stunted in eastern Africa, according to FAO. /CFP

Adan Haji Yusuf, the chairperson of the alliance, stressed the essential role of parliamentarians in combating hunger and malnutrition. He highlighted that their legislative, budgetary, and oversight responsibilities uniquely position them to elevate the importance of food and nutrition security to the highest levels of the political and legislative agenda.

Moses Wetangula, speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya, said Africa has struggled with poverty and hunger despite having all the necessary agricultural resources and policy instruments. Wetangula questioned why Africa, with its vast arable land, dynamic youth, favorable weather, and abundant water, has not been able to achieve food self-sufficiency and social transformation over an extended period.

""I urge fellow parliamentarians to shift their attention towards fulfilling the crucial investment requirements for agriculture, as outlined in the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, which stipulates that countries allocate ten percent of their national budget to agriculture,"" he said.

According to recent FAO data for 2023, 135 million people in eastern Africa are undernourished, almost half of the 282 million undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa. Some 22 million children under 5 years old are stunted, and 362 million people, representing 85 percent of the region's population, cannot afford a healthy diet, FAO said.

David Phiri, special adviser to FAO assistant director-general and outgoing sub-regional coordinator for Eastern Africa, underlined the pressing concerns of both climate change and food insecurity and malnutrition in the Eastern African region. Phiri said that even though the sub-region hosts less than 25 percent of the African population, it accounts for almost 50 percent of the undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa.

He emphasized that the bidirectional relationship between climate change and agriculture creates an unprecedented challenge for the farming population, noting that extreme weather events, which mainly occur due to climate change, are becoming among the major triggers of such a predicament.

The Eastern Africa Parliamentary Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, established in April 2019 in Arusha, Tanzania, comprises members of Parliament from Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda."

 Some scientists are pushing for warnings on foods such as fast food burgers to display they are bad for your health, joined with their impact on the planet.

A group of American researchers tested the climate-change warnings on fast food menus and found they encourage people to make more sustainable dietary decisions.

The labels were colored-coded. A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.

Environmental guilt was more effective than the green ""good for the planet"" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.

British consumers already are used to the ""traffic-light"" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.

A new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.

Their study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

They tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.

They had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, ""This item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change,"" to green one which read, ""This item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.""

The study found red labels to be the most effective at 23.5% more than the comparative choosing nonbeef in the control group.

Only 10% of people chose green, compared to the control group.

The lead author of the study, professor Julia Wolfson, an expert in food policy at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the results showed an effectiveness with the red-style labeling.

""We found that labeling red meat items with negatively framed, red high–climate impact labels was more effective at increasing sustainable selections than labeling non-red meat items with positively framed, green low–climate impact labels,"" she said.

Wolfson added those who were likely to choose green labels tended to eat healthier than the control. This is despite no fast food included on the menu.

She said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.

""It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,"" Wolfson said."

 Proposed new emissions standards would ""move (the) U.S. car market decisively toward electric vehicles,"" the agency revealed, adding that it hopes to convert ""up to [two-thirds]"" of all cars sold to EV models by the year 2032.

If implemented, the EPA policy would force most new cars sold by that year to be EVs – no gas allowed, meaning they cannot even be hybrids. Not long after that, the agency hopes to axe all gas cars from the market entirely.

The program would be phased in starting in 2027, when all light-duty vehicles sold new will need to meet new greenhouse gas performance standards. By 2032, between 64 and 67 percent of all new car sales would need to be EVs only.

""This is the planned rationing of vehicles,"" says Marc Morano of The Climate Depot. ""The planned rationing of American cars. That's the only way this plan makes sense ... the only result is going to be shortages of cars and a completely altered used car market.""

(Related: In case you missed it, the Biden regime also proposed a nationwide ban on gas stoves last fall, but then relented due to widespread unpopularity.)

As explained by Morano, all of this is exactly what happened to places like Cuba and East Germany, which succumbed to communism under similar circumstances.

""You can look to Cuba to find out what it's like to have a raging used car market because that's what we're looking at here,"" he warns.

""And you can look to old East Germany. East Germany had their famed Trabant car, where people would have to get on waiting lists for years to get one, and that's what we're faced with here when the government is going to mandate that you can only buy a new electric car.""

The left-wing obsession with all things electric is nonsensical from the perspective of affordability and reliability. Earth-based fuels like oil and gas are abundant, inexpensive, and highly reliable, while electric power is expensive, unreliable, and just plain stupid.

How will the average person power his EV in the event of a power outage? What about when he becomes stranded out in the middle of nowhere with no charging stations anywhere in sight?

In the United States, at least, there is still time to stop this madness. Our country does not have to go the way of Australia, where some banks are now refusing to finance loans for people wanting to purchase gas-powered vehicles.

The World Bank is also moving in the same direction, having promised to phase out all funding for gas-powered cars in the shockingly near term.

""The powers that be, the corporate world, the bankers, the governments, academia – they've decided that gas-powered cars are over and they're putting all the forces into play to end it without our say in it,"" Morano warns.

Then we have the Biden regime, which wants the imposition of new pollution limits that would force at least 54 percent of all new vehicles to be sold as electric models by the year 2030.

""I believe it's pretty doable,"" said Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama regime EPA official. ""The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the U.S., China is ahead of Europe, and these companies are global companies.""

 LONDON (AP) – New and expanded powers for British police took effect on Sunday, including measures targeting activists who stop traffic and major building works with protests.

Authorities have repeatedly condemned environmental protest groups, including Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, which have sought to raise awareness about the urgency of climate change by staging multiple high-profile protests at the busiest highways and roads. Their protests in recent years often caused serious disruption for motorists.

From Sunday, police will have powers to move static protests. Critics have argued the toughened laws are a threat to the right to protest, but U.K. officials say the measures were to stop “disruption from a selfish minority.”

“The public have had enough of their lives being disrupted by selfish protesters. The mayhem we’ve seen on our streets has been a scandal,” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said.

Authorities say that under the new Public Order Act, protesters found guilty of “tunnelling” – or digging underground tunnels to obstruct the building of new infrastructure works – could face three years in prison. Anyone found guilty of obstructing a major transportation project could be jailed for up to six months.

The law also makes “locking on,” or protesters attaching themselves to other people, objects or buildings, a criminal offense.

Hundreds of climate change protesters were arrested last year in the U.K. for blocking major roads and bridges. Many activists protested by sitting in the middle of the roads or gluing themselves to the roadway to make them harder to move.

The civil disobedience is a wave of direct action that has also seen activists glue themselves to famous museum paintings or throw soup at artworks to draw media attention to their cause.

Police have said it’s costly to deal with the protests and that they diverted thousands of officers from other work like dealing with crime.

JBS says it will ""achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040"" while still implementing plans to ""increase production."" In James' view, this means that JBS will increase its carbon footprint over the next 16 years.

""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James commented about the case.

""Until now, growth factors had to be added to the surrounding liquid, or media,"" reported SciTechDaily about how bovine muscle cells can now produce their own growth factors thanks to technological developments from David Kaplan, a professor at the Tufts University Center for Cellular Agriculture (TUCCA).

""Made from recombinant (genetically engineered) protein and sold by industrial suppliers, growth factors contribute to a majority of the cost of production for cultivated meat (up to or above 90%). Since the growth factors don’t last long in the cell culture media, they also have to be replenished every few days. This limits the ability to provide an affordable product to consumers. Taking that ingredient out of the growth media leads to an enormous cost savings.""

In other words, the real beef industry is being attacked on all sides with mysterious fires and lawsuits while the emerging synthetic beef industry is making major strides in reducing production costs. Can you say conspiracy?

""It just so happens as a matter of splendid serendipity that billionaire-funded lab-meat startups ramping up production coincides with the forced elimination via legal fiat of actual beef production by their minions who control DA offices from coast to coast,"" is how independent journalist Ben Bartee put it.

In the comments, someone wrote that this is clearly not a coincidence as ""their plans,"" referring to the powers that be, ""should be plain as the nose on a normie's face ... Operative words: should be.""

""Franken-farming, AI drone-operated farmerless farms, synthetic food, and the 'China Model,'"" wrote another about the takeover of food by evil, also citing this article by researcher Sandi Adams.

If the climate really is changing, it is because of all the green nonsense like synthetic, lab-grown ""meat."" Learn more at Climate.news.

 The United Nations alarmist-in-chief António Guterres has denounced “climate-related carnage” in Pakistan caused by “apocalyptic flooding.”

Apparently unable to sympathize with those in need without invoking the bogeyman of global warming, Guterres took advantage of Pakistan’s flooding plight to advance his crusade against the “climate crisis.”

“I will never forget the climate-related carnage I saw after apocalyptic flooding submerged a third of Pakistan,” the U.N. chief declared Wednesday on Twitter (now X). “I call on donors & international financial institutions to make good on their funding pledges in support of recovery efforts as soon as possible.”

In a separate Tweet Wednesday, the veteran Portuguese socialist asserted that the “climate emergency is threatening the very survival of communities & economies that depend on tourism,” before touting “green investments” as well as “investing in sustainable tourism.”

According to the U.N. Secretary-General, those working for real Climate Action are “on the right side of history” since the battle to stop global warming constitutes the “fight of our lives.”

Guterres’ bombast has been heating up much faster than the environment.

Just this month, Guterres said that humanity must urgently find solutions to climate change because it “has opened the gates of hell.”

“Horrendous heat is having horrendous effects,” Guterres warned in his opening remarks at the U.N. Climate Ambition Summit in New York. “Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.”

This summer, he said that “the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived” (emphasis added).

He also claimed that the “dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” adding that the “climate breakdown has begun.”

Guterres has placed the blame for the climate crisis on “our fossil fuel addiction,” insisting that “climate is imploding faster than we can cope.”

While wild hyperbole and theatrical rhetoric may work in advertising, one cannot help but wonder whether they do not diminish the seriousness of Mr. Guterres’ case and indeed of his office.

 President Joe Biden intends to replace outgoing World Bank president David Malpass with a candidate willing to refocus the institution on climate change activism, a longtime goal of the administration, Axios reported Thursday, citing anonymous White House advisers.

Malpass — a Trump appointee and husband to Daily Caller News Foundation president Adele Malpass — on Wednesday announced his intention to step down from his post on June 30, more than eight months before his five-year term was set to end. For his replacement, the Biden administration is seeking a diverse candidate that will reshape the World Bank, from its current focus on poverty alleviation to an institution with a broader focus on climate change goals such as reduced emissions, Axios reported. (RELATED: Trump-Appointed World Bank President Announces Resignation)

The details of Malpass’ departure had reportedly made their way to the Biden administration several weeks ago, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s statement regarding his decision coming just minutes after Malpass’ own announcement, Axios reported. Malpass has faced calls from environmentalists to resign since September, after he responded to a question about whether human burning of fossil fuels was a driver of dangerous global warming by claiming that he was not a scientist.

This afternoon, I met with the @WorldBank Group’s Board of Directors and informed them of my intention to step down by the end of our June 30 fiscal year.

It has been an honor & privilege to serve as World Bank President. I have written more on @LinkedIn: https://t.co/ZGtTjh4BpL

— David Malpass (@DavidMalpassWBG) February 15, 2023

The Biden administration had previously considered taking steps to oust Malpass from his role at the U.N.-backed World Bank following his September comments, but decided against it, in part to ensure that the U.S. would retain its informal right to name the president of the body, Axios reported. Yellen last Thursday called for the World Bank to expand its scope beyond its current focus on poverty reduction and “take decisive action on global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation request for comment.

 Roads will be blocked, cities shut down, airports targeted, marches begun and chanting, lots of chanting, will combine Friday as climate protesters around the world rally to demand an immediate end to fossil fuel use.

That’s the plan, anyway, with the so-called Global Climate Strike 2023 destined to last through the weekend and end late Sunday.

AP reports the mass public action — driven by several mostly youth-led, local and global climate groups and organizations, including Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future movement — will take place in dozens of countries and in at least 50 cities worldwide for 72-hours.

WATCH: Greta Thunberg Calls for “Drastic Emissions Cuts” to “Fundamentally Change Our Society”

The protest demands include – but are not restricted to – “divesting from new and current fossil fuel projects, sharing the burden equally among society, investing in community-owned renewable energy projects, and paying reparations to communities affected by the climate crisis,” Euronews reports.

Organisers said their climate protest would call on governments to end subsidies for oil and gas immediately and to cancel any plans for expanding fossil fuel production.

Financial institutions of all types around world will also face protests and a call for them to end funding fossil fuel development.

In one strike in Quezon City in the Philippines, AP reports activists lay in front of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in protest, and held signs demanding fossil fuels — from coal to natural gas — be phased out.

Another major mass action is planned to take place Sunday in New York, to coincide with the city’s Climate Week and the U.N. climate summit.

Climate activists have organized similar worldwide strikes in recent years, where protesters from different nations join together on a single day.

The “climate strike” comes two months before this year’s United Nations COP28 climate summit, where more than 80 countries plan to push for a global agreement to phase out coal, oil and gas.

 Help keep One Green Planet free and independent! Together we can ensure our platform remains a hub for empowering ideas committed to fighting for a sustainable, healthy, and compassionate world. Please support us in keeping our mission strong.

Two climate activists disrupted the National Archives rotunda and galleries in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon. The perpetrators, identified as Donald Zepeda, 35, and Jackson Green, 27, both residents of Washington, D.C., dumped red powder on the case housing the U.S. Constitution, prompting an early closure of the premises to the public.


The National Archives, in a press release, reassured the public that the encasement shielded the Constitution from any harm. However, conservators are assessing the extent of the damage caused to the rotunda. The suspects were promptly apprehended and escorted out by security personnel.

The motive behind the act appears to be linked to climate change activism. A video circulating on social media captured the moment when the two men, drenched in red powder, delivered prepared speeches regarding Climate change while standing before the Constitution’s protective case.

“We are determined to foment a rebellion,” declared one of the men in the video. “We all deserve clean air, water, food, and a livable climate.” The group Declare Emergency, a Climate change activism organization, confirmed to NBC Washington that the detained individuals were indeed members of their movement.

Colleen Shogan, the Archivist of the United States, expressed deep concern over the violation of the sanctity of the National Archives Rotunda, emphasizing its significance as the repository of the nation’s founding documents.

“The National Archives Rotunda is the sanctuary for our nation’s founding documents. They are here for all Americans to view and understand the principles of our nation,” Shogan stated. “We take such vandalism very seriously and we will insist that the perpetrators be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

As a consequence of the disruption, the National Archives Rotunda will remain closed for cleaning on Thursday, while the rest of the building will continue to operate on its regular schedule.

West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore lead the way earlier this year in removing Wall Street financial firms from holding state funds due to ‘Environmental, Social and Governance’ or ‘ESG’ climate change ideology driving investment decisions.

West Virginia had been the tip of the spear since early 2021 {link} removing Blackrock in January of 2022, and even removed banking contracts from multiple investment firms during the battle and asked other states to join in the effort {link}.

Today, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis announced the DeSantis administration would be following the lead from West Virginia.

[FLORIDA] – […] State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis announced Thursday that Florida will immediately freeze about $1.43 billion in long-term securities and about $600 million in short-term overnight investments managed by BlackRock because of the firm’s use of “Environmental, Social, and Governance” standards — known as ESG.

Patronis in a prepared statement said he doesn’t “trust BlackRock’s ability to deliver” and “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is on a campaign to change the world.”

“Whether stakeholder capitalism, or ESG standards, are being pushed by BlackRock for ideological reasons, or to develop social credit ratings, the effect is to avoid dealing with the messiness of democracy,” Patronis said.

Republican leaders in Florida and across the country have targeted ESG ratings, which can involve considering a wide range of issues in investments, such as companies’ climate-change vulnerabilities; carbon emissions; racial inequality; product safety; supply-chain labor standards; privacy and data security; and executive compensation.

Patronis said the state Department of Financial Services oversees about $60 billion and that the money with BlackRock will be moved “elsewhere.” (read more)

As part of the ongoing 2024 positioning effort, the ConInc influencers in/around Florida Governor Ron DeSantis attempted to claim Florida had led the way on the initiative. However, the reality of DeSantis as a bandwagoneer is brutally obvious to anyone who followed the previous effort and the backlash against West Virginia.

It’s good to see Florida join the effort.

I’m glad Florida followed West Virginia’s lead in pulling money away from BlackRock.

EN_CC_200083.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Climate insanity: Bill Gates invests in Aussie firm looking to address COW BURPS 

 According to a press statement, Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) alongside Harvest Road Group raised a total of $12 million for the Perth, Western Australia-based startup Rumin8. The startup examines solutions to decrease livestock emissions, with a focus on a dietary supplement for cattle with ""anti-methanogenic properties.""

Rumin8's dietary supplement is synthesized from bromoform, an active ingredient in red seaweed, that prevents the creation of methane. The anti-methanogenic compounds in bromoform can target and eradicate bacteria producing the gas, reportedly cutting down on methane emissions and conserving animals' energy.

According to the startup, early trials on cows fed with the supplement saw a more than 85 percent reduction in methane emissions. This amounts to two tons of greenhouse gases removed each year for every cow being fed. Identical technologies in other nations also indicate that feeding anti-methanogenic supplements could lead to cattle and sheep conserving more energy for food production.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) developed a comparable version in 2022 that decreased methane production by up to 20 percent. The supplement also helped increase milk production in cows. ICAR used tannins and compounds found in legume plants for its dietary supplement.

The agricultural industry has been under fire for greenhouse gas emissions, specifically methane. According to a 2013 report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has 80 times the planet-warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years that it lingers in the atmosphere.

The globalist group also mentioned that methane accounts for around 30 percent of global warming that has happened since the Industrial Revolution. Agricultural methane released from livestock burps, farts and manure account for 32 percent of methane emissions.

Gates, who is a big fan of the latest technologies to fight climate change, has supported companies working on all types of solutions, including next-generation nuclear reactors and cutting-edge carbon capture designs. (Related: Why is Bill Gates buying up farmland across America?)

As reported in the statement, the recent funds will ""accelerate Rumin8's road to commercialization,"" as the firm plans out fresh international trials, branding projects and a pilot manufacturing plant.

""The demand for sustainable protein has never been more apparent, which is why BEV is keenly interested in reducing methane emissions from beef and dairy,"" Carmichael Roberts, co-lead at the corporation’s investment committee, said in the statement.

Gates' investment in Rumin8 signals his first Australian venture with Breakthrough Energy, but it is far from his first investment in climate tech-startups.

""We’re invested now in over 100 startups. This one here in Australia, Rumin8, I think it's the 103rd,"" Gates said during a recent interview in Sydney with Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank. The billionaire added that around six percent of global planet-warming emissions come from cows.

""It’s great to have Australia engaged in climate. The world isn't going to trade with people who don't have serious climate commitments. Australia was a bit of an outlier until quite recently.""

Watch this video of Bill Gates explaining why cows need to be changed, given that they account for six percent of global emissions.

This video is from the Thrivetime Show channel on Brighteon.com.

Video shows Bill Gates admitting ""clean energy"" solving climate change is a SCAM.

Most scientists agree that changing climate conditions have nothing to do with human activity.

In a recently unearthed video of the College of Global Public Health Center for Bioethics at New York University Director, Dr. Matthew Liao, speaking at the 2016 World Science Festival, he openly advocates artificially inducing a red meat allergy in the entire human population, using an analog of the algha-gal molecule found in the Lone Star Tick that I have documented previously at Armageddon Prose, so as to fight “climate change.”


“People eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet.

But people are not willing to give up meat. Some people will be willing to, but other people – they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say ‘this steak is just too juicy, I can’t do that.’ I’m one of those by the way.

So here’s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about — we have these intolerances… For example, I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we’re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins…

There’s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat… So that’s something we can do through human engineering. We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.”

This level of evil – openly plotting to trigger autoimmune disease in humans without their consent at the population level – is nearly unspeakable.

At the same forum, Liao advocated “editing” humans to become “so small that we get eaten by cats,” again for the sake of “climate change.”

Were these psychopaths to succeed with this and any of their many other bioengineering projects under the guises of Public Health™, fighting “climate change,” etc., then nothing the Third Reich did, or even fantasized doing in Dr. Mengele’s wildest dreams, to the undesirables would remotely compare.

This is a war – of a different kind than we have seen historically – “unrestricted warfare,” as the CCP calls it — but a war nonetheless. As such, we need Nuremberg II now. People like Matthew Liao are not civilians; they must be reclassified as enemy combatants and given military tribunal trials.

I don’t know how this is going to be politically feasible, given the highly controlled and totally compromised political machine in the US and across the West, “penetrated” by the WEF, in the words of Klaus Schwab, as they are."

 Feds Using ‘Data’ from Temperature Stations That No Longer Exist to ‘Prove’ Global Warming

Once again, we see the fraud of climate change as it has been revealed that the federal government is using “data” from temperature stations that haven’t even existed for years.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses data from its system of temperature stations erected across the nation to predict what the temps will be in the future. They use what is called the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN), which has physical stations all over the country.

But, the problem is, a large number of the stations they claim to be using don’t even exist.

So, how does NOAA use temperature data that doesn’t exist?

Will this presidential election be the most important in American history?

Per Zero Hedge:

The problem, say experts, is that an increasing number of USHCN’s stations don’t exist anymore.

“They are physically gone—but still report data—like magic,” said Lt. Col. John Shewchuk, a certified consulting meteorologist.

“NOAA fabricates temperature data for more than 30 percent of the 1,218 USHCN reporting stations that no longer exist.”

He calls them “ghost” stations.

Mr. Shewchuck said USHCN stations reached a maximum of 1,218 stations in 1957, but after 1990 the number of active stations began declining due to aging equipment and personnel retirements.

NOAA still records data from these ghost stations by taking the temperature readings from surrounding stations, and recording their average for the ghost station, followed by an “E,” for estimate.

So much for “science.”

If you can’t prove it… just make it up.

This is from the “trust the science” fools.

 A report from these two schools says that with the exception of Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast, all other smaller and local airports will need to disappear by 2029 in order for the war on ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" to eventually be won.

Air travelers who require regional transfers to and from the three larger airports after that time will need to take rail or a car instead, as these are considered by the globalists to be much better forms of transport for the climate.

The only way for even Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast to remain open between 2029 and 2049 is if all other airports close down by 2029, and if all air transfers within the UK be migrated to ground transfers. If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.

After that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will ""cool"" down the planet and create a climate utopia.

""In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,"" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.

In order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates ""emissions,"" regardless of the energy source.

Meat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.

By 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be ""phased out"" between 2030 and 2049.

No more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.

""The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,"" the report states. ""This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.""

The report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the ""pandemic.""

""It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,"" is how The Expose puts it.

 In recent months, climate change exremists have taken to vandalizing pieces of fine art, smearing famous paintings and sculptures with soup and paint.

Some of these supposed activists are acutally being funded by people in Hollywood, who you would think had some sort of respect for fine art.

In truth, they care more about the left’s radical agenda.

The Washington Examiner reports:

Hollywood and left-wing foundations behind climate charity quietly bankrolling extremist protest groups

A little-known climate change advocacy organization heavily funded by celebrities and influential left-leaning foundations has been quietly dishing out grants to various activist groups deploying unorthodox and extremist methods across the world to protest fossil fuels, documents reveal.

Anti-fossil fuels groups have been ramping up protests in the United States and overseas as part of a coordinated campaign to bring awareness to climate change by vandalizing fine art, blocking major roads, and even gluing themselves to sports cars. Many of these activist hubs are being bankrolled by Climate Emergency Fund, a Beverly Hills-based charity linked to Hollywood celebrities and top liberal nonprofit organizations aiming to shape the Democratic Party’s agenda, according to tax forms and other documents reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

“Climate Emergency Fund has quickly become the ATM that radical environmental activists turn to fund their latest disruptions,” Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the conservative watchdog Americans for Public Trust, told the Washington Examiner. “And as their destruction increases, so should the scrutiny on who is bankrolling the Climate Emergency Fund and their ties to more mainstream environmental groups that might disagree with these over-the-top and dangerous tactics.”…

And, unlike the typical run-of-the-mill charity, CEF boasts a star-studded cohort of financial backers and board members, including Rory Kennedy, daughter of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy, Aileen Getty, the billionaire philanthropist and heiress of the Getty family fortune earned in the petroleum industry, and even Hollywood’s Adam McKay, who pledged it $4 million in September 2022 and directed the 2021 climate allegory film Don’t Look Up.

CEF celebrity funders also include Jeremy Strong, who plays Kendall Roy in the HBO TV series Succession, comedian Chelsea Handler, actor and Silicon Valley star Thomas Middleditch, and Abigail Disney, daughter of ex-Disney executive Roy E. Disney, according to CEF’s annual 2022 report.

Take a bow, Hollywood liberals. This is what you are funding:

 Exploiting their slight edge in number in the state's House of Representatives, 70-64, the Democrats on Jan. 26 passed the historic legislation banning the mining of primary fossil fuels. This coincided with Biden banning mining in the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota, which is marked by four major iron ore deposits. (Related: FORCE MAJEURE: Massive global shutdowns are now under way for METALS SMELTING operations covering iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, zinc and STEEL.)

According to Alpha News, the bill on the mining ban got passed after seven hours of debate with the Republicans, who offered several amendments to make the timeline more manageable but got rejected.

The junked amendments included ""lifting the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants; allowing for the use of carbon sequestration technologies; and delaying the standard to consider its impact on child and slave labor in the green energy supply chain.""

Rep. Spencer Igo (R-Wabana Township) said at a press conference ahead of the debate that the bill will make ""Minnesota reliant on nations around the globe that have no labor standards and no environmental standards. Minnesota in this bill will build a clean grid economy on the backs of child slaves in China and poor environmental regulations in Indonesia and the Congo.""

Igo lamented that the resources to build a clean energy future are right there in Minnesota, which leads the nation in iron ore production, but the federal government opted to ban mining in the state.

""The third-largest deposits of copper, nickel and cobalt that exist in the known world are only 250 miles north of this Capitol. Instead of investing in those resources … we have decided to export it around the world where carbon emissions will be 20, 25 or 30 times higher than if we were to do it here in Minnesota,"" Igo said.

Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdraws around 225,504 acres of land in the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota from mineral leasing, according to a Jan. 26 press release.

The move drew criticism from mining associations and lawmakers who believe mining is necessary for the country's mineral security and could harm the interests of Twin Metals, a major mining company that seeks to build an underground mine in Ely, a small city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota.

Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), who represents the region where a proposed copper-nickel mine was to be set up by Twin Metals, called the Biden administration's decision ""an attack on our way of life.""

Meanwhile, National Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan said the decision is ""nonsensical"" considering that the U.S. is looking to be a ""leader in manufacturing, innovation and climate.""

According to Nolan, the government has imposed the mining moratorium at a time when the demand for minerals like nickel, cobalt and copper is ""skyrocketing"" because of their ""widespread application in solar and wind infrastructure as well as electric vehicles.""

Nolan pointed out that these lands could provide U.S. manufacturers with ""plentiful sources"" of minerals apart from providing high-paying domestic jobs. Further, the country is losing out on mining operations that would have been implemented in compliance with environmental and safety regulations.

Of course, these observations wouldn't be heeded by Biden and the Democrats. They want to flaunt their power with no regard for what is truly beneficial for the Minnesotans and Americans in general.

 Ontario farmer speaks out against the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax

On April Fools’ Day, the Justin Trudeau Liberals authored a very bad joke. Namely, the much-hated carbon tax spiked yet again. These vile virtue-signalers are hellbent on “saving the planet” while they force more Canadians into bankruptcy.

Not that Liberal members of Parliament are fretting over this fiscal kick to the crotch, mind you. Because on that very same day the carbon tax increased, MPs benefited from a 4% pay raise. Must be nice. But if this is some sort of April Fools’ Day joke, we’re still searching for the punchline.

Protests regarding the carbon tax increase erupted across our great dominion last Monday, including one in Uxbridge, Ont., where dozens of farmers assembled outside an arena. Can you blame them? The Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) estimate that by 2030, Ontario grain and oilseed farmers alone will pay a staggering $2.7 billion in carbon taxes.

Rebel News journalist David Menzies (@TheMenzoid) reports from Uxbridge, Ont. as farmers take to the streets in opposition to the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax increase.— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) April 4, 2024

One of the farmers demonstrating in Uxbridge was Ted Eng, 71. He lamented that too many farmers are in a money-losing position now thanks to rising costs and labour rates. And increasing the tax threshold is akin to tossing gasoline on a bonfire.

Ted noted that if he were to sell his farm today, it would likely go for about $4 million. He’d be able to pocket the windfall and comfortably retire. But he doesn’t want to. He loves the land. He loves farming. He believes he’s going to die on his farm.

Canadians should be grateful that there are farmers like Ted Eng. Their efforts produce the food that ends up in supermarkets. If farmers are taxed out of existence, then goodbye food security as our meat and potatoes would have to be imported from other nations that have governments that are more farm friendly.

Check out our interview with Ted Eng, who has much to say about the sorry state of farming these days… not that the Trudeau Liberals give a rodent’s rectum."

 Much to its evident discomfort, the BBC has been forced to acknowledge the obvious, that for weeks now, the UK’s weather has been unsettled – with widespread rain, cooler temperatures and an autumnal feel.

Without doubt, the broadcaster would prefer us to be roasting in a prolonged heatwave to support its treasured “global boiling” thesis, matching the situation in much of southern Europe, which it reports has been enduring dangerous heatwaves that have seen temperatures top 40ºC and large wildfires.

That we are not frying to order is obviously something that cannot be tolerated without trying to explain away the anomaly, which the BBC attempts to explain away by telling us that the two extremes of weather are linked. Crucially, we are told, “it’s down to where the jet stream is”.

In an appeal to authority, without identifying any specific sources, Esme Stallard, climate and science reporter, with the assistance of all-purpose hack Sean Seddon, tell us that “meteorologists say” the wet and cool weather is due to the position of the jet stream, a core of strong winds sitting about five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface, and which dictate much of the UK’s weather.

The jet stream, we are then told, marks the boundary of cold air to the north in the polar regions and hot air to the south, a contrast which produces pressure differences. And last year, the jet stream was positioned further north, so the UK saw warm and dry weather created by the high-pressure system sitting over the country.

According to these BBC sages, what is different about this month is that the jet stream has been stuck to the south of the UK, meaning its low-pressure system has been bringing cold and wet weather.

This is actually a pretty poor explanation of the meridional flow pattern which has been dominating the weather for a couple of years now, but that is of less concern than the need to tie in the phenomenon with global warming.

And here, the formula used is classic is its dishonesty. “Some scientists think”, we are told, as if that is sufficient authority for what comes next. These wondrously anonymous “scientists” apparently think that higher temperatures due to climate change in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of high pressure and hot weather remaining in place. But that’s it – that’s all we get, followed by the assertion that “global warming means hot temperatures and wetter periods will become more typical for the UK”.

 The World Economic Forum-aligned Netherlands government has vowed to forcibly seize 600 farms deemed to be disrespecting the WEF’s green agenda.

Dutch farmers’ organizations have vowed to launch more protests in the Netherlands in response to advice from the government’s mediator, who has demanded the seizure and relocation of farming firms and the seizure of up to 600 farms deemed to be the heaviest nitrogen emitters.


The move by the Dutch government comes just weeks after Bill Gates was caught admitting the climate change agenda is a scam for the New World Order in a newly surfaced video in which he boasts that the term “clean energy” has “screwed up people’s minds.”

According to Gates, who was speaking to an audience of his inner circle, wind, solar, battery technology and other renewable energy sources might be fashionable, but they are NOT capable of solving climate change.

Breitbart report: Farmers Defence Force leader Mark Van den Oever announced this week that Dutch farmers will once again take to the streets after the government expressed its intentions to adopt the plan presented by former deputy prime minister Johan Remkes to meet the nitrogen standards demanded by the European Union.

Remkes, who has been serving as the chief mediator between farmers’ organizations and the government in the ongoing dispute over nitrogen emissions, laid out a plan last week that would see farms located close to protected environments forcibly relocated and a scheme for the government to seize up to 600 farms that emit the most nitrogen.

In response to the plan, Van den Oever said that the scheme was “completely wrong” and that the farmers of the nation would “give the old-fashioned gas again, count on that” — in reference to the widespread tractor protests by farmers over the summer.

The Farmers Defence Force leader said that ministers have ignored the concerns of farmers and that the globalist government of Prime Mnister Mark Rutte “imposes far too much on businesses”.

The plan to relocate farms has drawn particular ire from the organisation, with spokesman Sieta van Keimpema describing the measure as a “red line” for farmers.

Defending his proposals, Remkes said last week that, as a result of the European Union’s green agenda, “the Netherlands will be locked up because it will be legally almost impossible to issue permits. Not for houses, not for farms, not for roads.”

“I write this with a heavy heart, but I see no other way,” he said, adding: “I don’t expect the agricultural sector will be happy with this report.”

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced his intentions to cut nitrogen emissions from livestock farms in half by the year 2030 in order to satisfy goals laid out in the European Union’s Natura 2000 scheme, which requires that all EU member-states remove industry or farming from areas deemed to be of ecological importance.

The government has asserted to meet the EU goals, some farms may have to reduce their emissions by as much as 95 per cent and that up to 30 per cent of all livestock farms may be shut down permanently.

Following the announcement of the scheme, thousands of farmers staged protests throughout the country, with tractors being used to block highways and other critical infrastructure, and farmers dumping manure, tyres, and hay on motorways in defiance of the green agenda.

Speaking to Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM in July, Dutch political commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek said that her country was being used as a testing ground for the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset, saying that “all these policies are out of those institutions and they are being implemented in our country first, we are sort of the pilot country together with Canada for this agenda.”

Vlaardingerbroek went on to claim that the push from the government to seize farmland was, in fact, more a result of the migrant crisis than the alleged climate crisis, explaining that the government wants the land to house migrants. While not widespread as of yet, this has already occurred, with the province of Flevoland buying up land in Noordoostpolder to build an asylum processing centre on the site of a former farm."

 A report from these two schools says that with the exception of Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast, all other smaller and local airports will need to disappear by 2029 in order for the war on ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" to eventually be won.

Air travelers who require regional transfers to and from the three larger airports after that time will need to take rail or a car instead, as these are considered by the globalists to be much better forms of transport for the climate.

The only way for even Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast to remain open between 2029 and 2049 is if all other airports close down by 2029, and if all air transfers within the UK be migrated to ground transfers. If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.

After that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will ""cool"" down the planet and create a climate utopia.

""In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,"" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.

In order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates ""emissions,"" regardless of the energy source.

Meat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.

By 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be ""phased out"" between 2030 and 2049.

No more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.

""The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,"" the report states. ""This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.""

The report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the ""pandemic.""

""It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,"" is how The Expose puts it.

 Supposedly to prevent ""global warming"" and ""brain damage,"" Hochul and other left-wingers want only electric cooking appliances to be allowed in new construction. Were that to actually happen, cafes and other eateries would no longer be able to run their businesses.

""For 35 years, we've been attacked by everybody,"" Morfogen told Carlson. ""We had organized crime in our industry in the '30s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In the 2000s, we had corrupt Wall Street, and for the last three years we've had government overreach.""

""I mean, we've seen it during covid – they did things and never followed the science and what's going on. I heard a rumor about this last year, and what I'm hearing about today from the White House to Gov. Hochul, that they want to make us, for new restaurant construction, use electric stoves.""

Not only would gas stoves be banned in new construction under Hochul's plan, but so would gas heaters. Everyone would be forced to use costly and highly inefficient electric cooking and heating appliances, which would also place enormous strain on the electrical grid. (Related: In Europe, the ongoing energy crisis is causing some to have to burn wood for warm meals and heat.)

According to Hochul and other Democrats, the planet's climate is supposedly changing because of gas use. In order to stop the climate from changing, electric must be the only source of energy used – even if it comes from coal, ironically enough.

""So let me explain it to you: we lose 40 percent productivity by using electric,"" Morfogen further stated. ""If they inquire with small business owners, I'll give them three pieces of advice: get a stronger filtration system; get a hood system that works; and, basically, train your staff how to maintain it.""

Citing a single study claiming that gas stoves contribute to 12.7 percent of all cases of asthma in children, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is attempting to implement a nationwide ban on gas stoves – because freedom of choice is not one of that group's values.

""For 35 years, we continuously have obstacles in running our industry,"" Morfogen added during the interview.

""I've got to tell you, Tucker – and I want to thank you for supporting small business – since the last time I was on, you inspired me to write the book. And I've got to tell you, our journey is constantly being attacked, like, we're vulnerable and this is the crème de la crème, because I will tell you, this will destroy our industry just as bad as they attempted to do with covid.""

If you are interested in watching the Tucker Carlson segment featuring Morfogen, you can do so at this link.

Bearing the nickname ""Golden Greek,"" Morfogen has owned and operated a number of top restaurants in New York City – at least 41 of them, in fact. He told the New York Post last summer that thievery, economic downturns, demolition problems, and changing neighborhoods are among the many reasons why his restaurants have come and gone over the years.

""Our industry was then like the Wild West,"" he explained. ""There comes a knock on the door and you have to pay protection so the mob doesn't break your window or your manager's legs.""

The new mob, apparently, are Democrats and their ""green"" tyranny solutions to climate problems that are entirely nonexistent outside of their own deranged heads.

 A Monday Politico article claims Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could secretly care about global warming based on an application to build a seawall to protect a golf resort.

In reality, this only shows Trump uses global warming alarmism to benefit his business.

A permit application for the wall by Trump International Golf Links Ireland which was reviewed by Politico explicitly cites global warming and erosion due to rising sea levels as a justification to build the structure. However, the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group, not Trump’s business. The application clearly uses global warming to add urgency to a permit application to build a seawall which will protect his property from erosion and storms.

Trump’s previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Ireland’s national government, so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor. The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trump’s property.

“The zoning application raises further questions about how the billionaire developer would confront a risk he has publicly minimized but that has been identified as a defining challenge of this era by world leaders, global industry and the American military,” claims Politico. “His public disavowal of climate science at the same time he moves to secure his own holdings against the effects of climate change also illustrates the conflict between his political rhetoric and the realities of running a business with seaside assets in the 21st century.”

The real estate mogul has a long history of skepticism about global warming. Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a “hoax,” “mythical,” a “con job,” “nonexistent,” and “bullshit.” Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources. He views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China. Trump has also vowed to “at a minimum” renegotiate the United Nation’s December’s Paris climate deal.

Trump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming.

“I will say wind is a problem because it’s very expensive to build the towers, very, very expensive, and as you know when you have 40-dollar oil, it’s not economics, so they’re going to have to do a subsidy, otherwise wind isn’t going to work,” Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post.

Trump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort he owns. Trump publicly stated he would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead.

Trump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter, saying “nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy–a disaster for taxpayers” and asking “How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.”

Trump’s skepticism of solar power is equally well documented, as he said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are “economically, they’re not good. It’s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn’t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it’s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”

Trump’s stance on solar is markedly different from that of his likely Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to build “half a billion” solar panels. One of Clinton’s biggest financial backers, hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett, has invested billions into building just that type of solar panel."

 So, what’s this newfound hostility against the thing that keeps us alive?

Take a deep breath. Farming uses nitrogen, and suddenly, nitrogen is the new antagonist in the tale of global warming. The narrative is simple: eliminate nitrogen, and save the world. Yet, in the name of “preservation,” entire segments of our food production are under siege.

Consider rice – a staple for half the world’s population. Renowned agencies claim, “Rice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,” emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.

Look to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands. A staggering number, 3,000 farms, are forecasted to be confiscated in the coming years. The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.

Our friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either. The European Commission greenlit a strategy to compensate livestock farmers for halting their operations in certain areas – with a stipulation that they never resume their animal breeding activities. The implications are clear: a drop in global food availability and an inevitable spike in prices.

Remember Sri Lanka’s ill-fated venture into 100% organic farming? The island nation faced a humanitarian nightmare with a staggering 90% of its population on the brink of starvation.

Citing Lund University professor and eco-terrorism proponent Andreas Malm, the article attempts to make the case that destroying public and private property is a powerful way to save the planet from global warming.

""The task for the climate movement is to make clear for people that building new pipelines, new gas terminals, opening new oil fields are acts of violence that need to be stopped – they kill people,"" Malm is quoted as saying on Bloomberg's ""Green Zero"" podcast.

""We shouldn't engage in assassinations or terrorism, or use arms and things like that. But until that line or boundary, we need virtually everything ... all the way up to sabotage and property destruction."" (Related: The New York Times similarly promoted ""sabotage"" as the ""most effective"" way to prevent environmental ""breakdown"".)

Climate terrorism is already spreading like wildfire across Europe. In Marseilles, for instance, climate terrorists destroyed a cement factory because they believed it was releasing too much carbon dioxide and warming the planet. In London, climate terrorists threw tomato soup at a Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" painting as part of a ""Just Stop Oil"" protest.

There are not too many of them to begin with across the pond, but SUVs throughout Western Europe are turning up with flat tires as climate terrorists protest other people's use of larger vehicles, which they see as ""gas-guzzlers.""

These types of things please Malm, but he craves more destruction. According to him, this is only the beginning of what climate terrorists should be doing every day to stop all use of the earth's natural energy, i.e., natural gas and oil.

The good news is that many governments are increasing the penalties and punishments for climate terrorism. Just Stop Oil activist Jan Goodey was recently sentenced to six months in prison for disrupting a major London motorway, while a few months earlier a climate terrorist named Deanna ""Violet"" Coco received a 15-month prison sentence for blocking a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge for 28 minutes.

""That's what always happens when you escalate,"" Malm said smugly on the Bloomberg broadcast. ""As soon as you pose a danger to the system, this is what you'll get in return. And that's a sign that you're doing something good, that you are actually challenging some interests.""

In the comments, one reader wrote that he would like to see the punishments for climate terrorism become even more severe.

""Sentence them to 25 years minimum of extreme hard labor, or make them food for hungry animals,"" this person wrote. ""No animal should ever have to go hungry,"" he added jokingly.

Another wrote that true ecological activists who simply oppose needless environmental destruction have had their movements hijacked by communists who are running huge propaganda efforts to keep We the People fighting among ourselves as opposed to joining forces against these communists and their violent plans for the world.

""They are masters of destruction and of propaganda that dupes the masses into fighting among themselves instead of uniting to solve problems for everyone's benefit,"" this person wrote.

 Virginia is ditching rules that would have mandated 100% of new car sales to be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035.

Under former Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, the state enacted a law in 2021 that hitched it to California’s stringent vehicle emissions standards, the latest version of which will require the phase-out of internal combustion engine models by 2035. Current Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration announced Wednesday that Virginia will not be following California’s new regulations once the current set expires at the end of the year.

“Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can’t purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.” (RELATED: Glenn Youngkin And Virginia Universities Are In Bitter Battle Over Future Of Diversity, Equity And Inclusion On Campuses)

Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth.

— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) June 5, 2024

Youngkin has opposed the policy because “California’s requirements for their citizens should not be a one size fits all solution for Virginia,” the governor’s staff previously told to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Previous efforts by state Republicans to repeal the law linking Virginia to California’s standards failed, and legislative avenues to get rid of the rules closed when Democrats cemented control of the state legislature in last fall’s elections.

The governor’s office cited a legal opinion by Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares to substantiate its decision. Miyares’ opinion asserted that the state is not obligated to abide by the California Air Resource Board’s (CARB) Advanced Clean Cars II rules, which would have taken effect at the beginning of 2025 and required EVs to make up 35% of all new car sales starting in model year 2026 on the way to 100% by 2035.

“Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties,” Youngkin’s office said in the official announcement. “Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.”

Numerous Democrat-leaning or blue states have adopted CARB’s auto emissions standards, which are more stringent than federal standards, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Neither CARB nor the office of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded immediately to requests for comment."

 On Christmas day, when Christians are celebrating the birth of their Saviour, King Charles III used his Christmas message to push the “climate change” narrative.

“Out of God’s Providence, we are blessed with much and it is incumbent on us to use this wisely. However, service to others is but one way of honouring the whole of creation, which after all is a manifestation of the divine. This is a belief shared by all religions,” Charles III said.

Then he slipped seamlessly into climate activism. “To care for this creation is a responsibility owned by people of all faiths and of none. We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children. During my lifetime I’ve been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home we all share.”

What has that message got to do with the birth of Jesus and Jesus’ message for the world? Is he conflating religions? Is he attempting to dilute or usurp the “Our Saviour is born” message? Or, perhaps, he is attempting to merge his own beliefs into another to create a universal belief system he thinks we should all follow.

Below, Jordan Schachtel has more to say on Charles III using the world stage for his activism.

On Monday, King Charles III, who we sometimes refer to as the “WEF King” – because he’s one of the world’s most prominent anti-humans – dedicated a significant chunk of the Royal Family’s annual Christmas broadcast to the climate narrative.

Charles began with a unifying, apolitical message about having compassion for others, along with a plethora of unifying slogans, before quickly turning heel and going full Klaus Schwab mode, under the guise of presenting a cause that is greater than ourselves.

“We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children,” said Charles, who earlier this month flew on his very spacious private aircraft to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP 28”).

“During my lifetime I have been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home which we all share,” said Charles, who has been serving as king since September 2022.

 The Biden administration celebrated praise from a far-left climate alarmist group known for harassing public officials and blocking roads on Saturday.

Following its Friday announcement that it’s pulling the plug on several liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in the name of so-called “climate change,” the White House released a “WHAT THEY ARE SAYING” press release the following day that included remarks from left-wing climate activists and organizations celebrating the administration’s continued war on efficient sources of energy and the American consumer. [emphasis, links added]

Among the groups propped up by the administration is Climate Defiance, a radical environmentalist group comprised of young Marxists who regularly disrupt traffic and shout down U.S. politicians to coerce them into advancing their radical agenda.

According to InfluenceWatch, much of the organization’s funding comes from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a nonprofit “that channels money to groups engaged in climate activism.”

CEF has previously received funding from “former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Onward Together, liberal activist Abigail Disney, and oil heiress Aileen Getty’s Aileen Getty Foundation.”

In its Saturday release, the White House specifically highlighted Climate Defiance’s Jan. 26 tweet celebrating the administration’s “monumental” decision to ax the aforementioned LNG projects.

“Never thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail,” Climate Defiance’s X account posted on Sunday.

— Climate Defiance (@ClimateDefiance) January 28, 2024

Beyond funding from Democrat-aligned entities, Climate Defiance is more well-known for its goal of “making life MISERABLE for every person in power” who opts not to endorse its extreme agenda.

Earlier this month, for example, several of the group’s members “swarmed” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., while he was speaking at a New Hampshire diner.

Climate Defiance agitators chanted “anti-fossil fuels slogans” during Manchin’s remarks. One of them, carrying a sign “calling for the end of fossil fuel dependence,” reportedly jumped in front of the senator’s SUV as it was departing the venue.

The group claimed Manchin uses his position as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to “protect his personal coal company.”

Climate Defiance’s radical behavior doesn’t stop there.

Since its 2023 launch, the group has attempted to corner several high-ranking Democrats, including President Joe Biden.

According to InfluenceWatch, on April 29, its members “created a blockade to prevent elected officials from attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner at the Washington Hilton, hoping to see [the president] and demand an end to leasing public lands for fossil fuel projects.”

The organization’s members harassed Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a book launch event in May and “blocked traffic and protested outside” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s New York City residence later that same month.

Climate Defiance demonstrators were also reportedly removed from a June event hosted by the Detroit Free Press, at which Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was scheduled to speak.

Among the phrases shouted by agitators were, “No MVP. No LNG. Granholm, you are killing me,” and, “F-ck you, Jennifer. F-ck you, Joe Biden. F-ck all these politicians.”"

 On Saturday, Joe Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, committed the administration to the elimination of all coal-fired power plants.

U.S. Special Envoy John Kerry announced that America was joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which means the Biden Administration commits to building no new coal plants and phasing out existing plants. No date was given for when the existing plants would have to go, but other Biden regulatory actions and international commitments already in the works had meant no coal by 2035.

This is crazy and fascistic, as he calls for the elimination of a vital energy resource.

John Kerry demands the end of coal plants.— Daniel Turner (@DanielTurnerPTF) December 4, 2023

Here's what Kerry won't tell you:

- Coal is inexpensive, abundant, and reliable

- Solar manufacturing plants run on coal

- Wind manufacturing plants run on coal

- EV battery factories are powered by coal

Facts matter. pic.twitter.com/V8cX2injQu

Kerry says there shouldn't be any more permanent coal-fired power plants permitted anywhere in the world. He said that's how you can do something for ""health."" He said he finds himself getting more and more ""militant"" because he does not understand ""how adults [who] are in positions of responsibility can be avoiding responsibility for taking away those things that are killing people on a daily basis. And the reality is that the climate crisis and the health crisis are one and the same.""

Yikes! How dare anyone disagree with him, he seemingly thinks, while he's trying to crush industries and the jobs associated with them? We get that the Biden team doesn't care about that, as they race pell-mell ahead with their agenda.

But it gets worse, as Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) point out. While the Biden team is pushing for this radical agenda that would limit and harm the U.S., Kerry gave China a pass by locking them into the status of a ""developing country"" according to the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped to negotiate.

“At the time the Paris Agreement was signed, China was the world’s second largest economy, and had been so for many years. Nevertheless, the treaty you negotiated and agreed to locked into place China’s status as a developing country. That was as absurd then as it is now,” the senators wrote. [....]

“China is bent on global domination. It is the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is America’s chief economic and geopolitical rival. It exploits forced labor. It manipulates global markets. It steals our technology. It is building hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy,” the senators wrote. “It should not get special treatment in international climate agreements. There should be no more free rides for China. That should be non-negotiable.”

But it's the Biden team, where giving China a pass seems to be baked in, so they're building all the coal plants they can. And they're using them to help build all the green energy stuff that the Biden team wants to shove down our throats.

China is acting within, and taking advantage of, the international framework you helped create—the Paris Agreement. The Chinese coal plants to which you object now power mines and refineries producing critical minerals. They drive factories building solar panels, wind turbines, and electric batteries and cars that the Biden Administration wants to force Americans to buy.

So it's a double win for China, courtesy of the Biden administration. Once again, bad Democratic policy hurting the United States and being hypocritical."

 The New York Times is attempting to stoke climate alarm this week with an article claiming the world’s favorite scent – vanilla – is about to disappear because climate change is eradicating vanilla plants. [emphasis, links added]

In reality, objective data show vanilla production has doubled since the year 2000, and the current market is saturated with oversupply.

The Times article, “This Is How the World’s Favorite Scent Disappears,” notes vanilla is the world’s favorite scent and is used in a wide variety of perfumes and other products.

Citing anecdotal events like a cyclone that hit Madagascar several years ago during its annual cyclone season, the Times claims supersized cyclones are putting vanilla plants on the verge of extinction.

Interestingly, although the Times published its article just yesterday, the best anecdotal “evidence” for the asserted vanilla extinction was a cyclone that hit Madagascar way back in 2017 during its cyclone season.

According to the Times, Madagascar produces 80 percent of the world’s vanilla – actually, it produces significantly less than 80 percent – and:

“As a result [of the 2017 cyclone], the price of vanilla bean pods surged to nearly $300 a pound. The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers…”

So, why does the Times provide just anecdotal ‘evidence’ of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?

The answer is that objective facts expose the Times’ claim as false.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.

There is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.

“The 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,” observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.

The Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. “The oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,” the Crop Report adds.

Wow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!

The New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.

That is its sole “evidence” of climate change making vanilla go extinct.

In reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, … making farmers complain about low prices.

The New York Times and other “mainstream” media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.

As is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism’s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.

A company that makes fake meat won nearly $1.5 million from the Biden-Harris Department of Defense.

“The Better Meat Company, based in West Sacramento, California, was awarded $1.48 million to plan a bioproduction facility for mycoprotein ingredients that are shelf-stable, have high protein and fiber contents, and can be dehydrated,” the Pentagon announced.

The August grant comes just a month after the Pentagon announced it would no longer explore ways to feed troops “lab-grown meat,” following backlash in the media and from the beef industry.

A Pentagon spokesman repeated part of the news release in a statement to The Daily Wire and said the product will not be used in Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), a durable food package given to troops.

“We are investing in sources of protein such as chickpeas and tofu. The Department is not funding research into ‘lab-grown’ or ‘fake meat’ – nor does it have plans to include such protein substitutes in service members’ MREs,” the spokesman told The Daily Wire for an article earlier this week.

However, there is a connection between “mycoprotein” and the fake meat. The Daily Wire reported:

The grant will, however, fund a “facility for mycoprotein ingredients,” the same exact ingredient used to create the fake meat. The Daily Wire asked the Defense Department if these facilities will be used by the Better Meat Company to create fake meat during or after the grant term, but has not received a response.

Fake meat has been a favored tool of globalist elites and “climate change” activists because it ostensibly creates less pollution than cattle ranching, although that claim is questionable.

“Within current frameworks, governments can create clear, supportive, agile and efficient regulatory processes to ensure safe and transparent pathways that instill confidence in consumers and industry players alike, fostering a robust alternative protein market in a shift towards food systems that are more sustainable, secure and just,” a World Economic Forum report claimed.

The push for “alternative protein[s]” is to help countries reach the Paris Agreement’s radical environmentalist goals.

University of Southern California researchers also released a paper in August of this year detailing ways to encourage people to eat less red meat and testing the effectiveness of terms like “climate change” and “climate justice.”

As LifeSiteNews reported at the time:

The paper ultimately found that a willingness to eat less red meat fell along partisan lines, with Democrats being more eager to deny themselves the nutrient dense food, which is chock full of vitamins and proteins that aid in muscle growth. Republicans, on the other hand, were “often unresponsive” to changes in terminology.

The paper concludes that “climate change communications may therefore need to go beyond terminology.” It recommended that “effective communication strategies include using compelling everyday language, presenting clear graphs, emphasizing social norms, and making climate-friendly actions the default.”

The researchers said “conservative spokespeople” could be recruited to push Republicans to embrace the “climate change” agenda.

At the same time, some states have begun fighting back against the intrusion of lab-grown meat into grocery stores and onto kitchen tables.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in May of this year that bans the sale of lab-grown meat in the state of Florida. It is being challenged in court.

“While the World Economic Forum is telling the world to forgo meat consumption, Florida is increasing meat production, and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef,” a news release stated at the time.

Gov. DeSantis said the Sunshine State was “fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

“Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.”"

 President Joe Biden’s economic policies are top-down big government crony capitalism predicated on the false notion that he inherited an “economic catastrophe,” Breitbart Economics Editor John Carney said in a Friday interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow.

Biden again touted his “Bidenomics” economic policies in a speech in South Carolina Thursday, arguing that his administration is building “an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not trickling down.”

Carney, however, argued that Bidenomics is actually “built on a lie.”

“First of all, it’s built on a lie because the very beginning of Bidenomics is [Biden’s claim] ‘I inherited an economic catastrophe,’ which we know isn’t true. He didn’t inherit an economic catastrophe. He inherited an economy that was growing above six percent. He inherited an economic boom. So, everything since then has been a lie.”

“We got inflation because they lied that we were in an economic catastrophe, so they overspent,” he continued. “So, of course, right now you’re thinking, ‘Why can’t I make sense of this?’ It’s because it’s just lies.”

Carney then zeroed in on Biden’s “middle out and bottom up” claim.

“Nobody I’ve talked to can explain what ‘from the bottom up and the middle out’ means at all,” he said. “And that’s also not what they’re doing. When they are having government-directed money flowing into the economy—you know, all the subsidies for the Green New Deal stuff—that’s not from the bottom up. That’s the top down.”

“It’s a grift,” Kudlow added. “It’s money to donors, campaign donors. It’s money to big corporations who buy into their DEI and climate change stuff. It’s money to Democratic interest groups city by city, state by state. You are so right. It’s totally top down.”

“It’s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don’t trust Biden,” Carney noted.

An AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden’s economy is “poor,” and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.

Carney also commented on Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report “almost guarantees two more hikes” from the Federal Reserve.

He made this same point in Friday’s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages “are likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.”

 The climate change lobby is blissfully unaware of the consequences of being wrong. We are constantly reminded that higher electric bills are for our own good or that living with less is a moral choice. Most of us get poorer, but those who bet on carbon reduction and electric cars are making a killing.

There's a story, perhaps apocryphal, that during the siege of Stalingrad, children were given prizes of small pieces of cake for every rat they were able to catch. At the rate our civilization is going, we may be holding similar contests before too long.

Political scientist Roger Pielke Jr. notes, ""It's quite intuitive for people to understand that there's a lot of power in solar energy. We feel the wind. The idea that you can get something for nothing, people find enormously appealing.""

Except it's not ""something for nothing."" And we're paying extra for ""renewable energy"" despite all the promises.

California now requests all new homes to have solar panels. John Stossel points out that in addition to the solar panels, ""all new cars sold in 2035 to be zero emission, and all the state's electricity to come from carbon-free resources by 2045."" Anyone who questions this orthodoxy is dismissed as a crank.

But the fact is that we're hurtling toward a future where our energy needs are going to far exceed our ability to supply energy at any price. The reason is that we are deliberately removing viable choices for energy creation to ""save the planet.""

California is getting results in its renewable experiments. The problem is that they're not good results and only promise to get worse.

People in Washington state pay about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. In Oregon, 13 cents. In California, now almost 30 cents.

Do they at least get reliable energy for that? No.

The big problem with wind and solar power, of course, is that they don't work when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine. Sometimes that happens when people most want heat or air conditioning.

Increased use of ""renewables"" is why blackouts are more common in California. Bloomenergy says there were over 25,000 in 2019—thousands more than the previous year.

""We failed to predict and plan,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom. Right.

Instead, they embraced unscientific green fantasies.

Only by the grace of God and flyover country voting for Republicans have we been able to avoid the fate of Californians. But the California contagion will spread unless we're more vigilant. Biden has already relaxed his electric car mandate that would have required 67% of new cars sold by 2035 to be EVs after pressure from the auto unions. But other mandates on emissions remain.

This next election will determine whether we're going to have abundant energy for our future or whether our kids will become expert rat catchers."

 by Ethan Huff, Natural News:

Mainstream “news” is littered with scare stories about how global warming has apparently gotten so bad that the Antarctic ice shelves are melting. The truth, though, is that Antarctica’s ice shelves are actually growing in size.

New research published by Andreasen et al. looks at Antarctic-wide satellite data collected between 2009 and 2019. The data was compiled using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Between the 10-year period analyzed, Andreasen et al. discovered that the Antarctic ice shelf area grew in size by 5305 km2. Eighteen ice shelves did retreated in size somewhat during that time, but 16 others grew larger in terms of their overall area mass.

“Our observations show that Antarctic ice shelves gained 661 Gt of ice mass over the past decade,” the researchers noted in their paper.

(Related: When the next “catastrophe” strikes, climate-related or otherwise, Erie County, N.Y., is ready to impose more lockdowns – only “essential workers” with “movement passes” will be allowed to travel.)

Numerous studies confirm: Antarctic ice is doing just fine

Another study published by Banwell et al. that appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters looked at an even wider range of Antarctic ice data ranging from 1980 through 2021. That study utilized microwave satellite data from the snow model SNOWPACK.

Like the first study, this second one, which was published in 2023, found that the highest meltwater volumes occurred on Antarctica’s Peninsula, reaching a peak in 1992 and 1993, as well as in 1994 and 1995. SNOWPACK calculated “a small, but significant, decreasing trend in both annual melt days and meltwater production volume over the 41 years.”

Another paper published by Frazer et al. in the journal Nature backs these findings even further. This one explains that while dramatic ice losses are occurring in some areas of Antarctica, including in West Antarctica from Pine Island and the Thwaites glaciers, ice projections for the future cannot be accurately made.

This study, which looked at a time period ranging from 2003 through 2015, identified extensive glacial retreat and acceleration along the Bellinghausen Sea coastline. Conversely, things look rather well on the ice front along the Amundsen Sea.

“Our results provide direct observations that the pace, magnitude and extent of ice destabilization around West Antarctica vary by location, with the Amundsen Sea response most sensitive to interdecadal atmosphere-ocean variability,” the authors wrote.

Finally, another paper published by Baico et al., also in 2023, found that over the centuries, Antarctic ice has both thinned and thickened, depending on the time period.

The authors looked at subglacial bedrock cores to discover that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) between the Thwaites and Pope glaciers “was at least 35 m (meters) thinner than present in the past several thousand years and then subsequently thickened.”"

 Greta Thunberg was arrested by the Metropolitan Police for ‘refusing to move’ when told to by police officers during a protest against an oil and gas conference in central London, according to eyewitnesses.

The 20-year-old Swedish activist could be seen smiling as she was detained by officers and led to a waiting police van after joining a protest outside the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) – formerly the Oil and Money conference – at the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane.

In footage shared on social media, officers could be seen frogmarching the campaigner to the van as other protesters were told to stand back. The Met Police said it had arrested 21 protesters today.

Fossil Free London, which organised the demo, told the PA news agency that Thunberg was arrested while linking arms and changing with other activists; she was reportedly taken to Wandsworth police station.

It’s the latest arrest for the campaigner, who rose to fame after she began ‘striking’ from school in 2018 over what she said was inaction by world governments to tackle climate change.

 FACT CHECK: Did John Kerry’s Daughter Say Billions Must Die For ‘New World Order’?

A post shared on Facebook claims Vanessa Kerry, daughter of former U.S. climate envoy John Kerry, said billions of humans must die for the “New World Order.”

Verdict: False

There is no evidence Kerry said this. It originates from a site that is a regular source of misinformation and has been debunked by Check Your Fact several times in the past.

Fact Check:

Some studies have suggested that climate change may be causing more turbulence on airplanes, according to Washington Post. In spite of this, airlines are getting better at anticipating rough skies, meaning there may not be much change in the overall rate of turbulence, the outlet reported.

A Facebook post suggests Kerry has said people must die for the “New World Order.” The post shows an image of Kerry smiling above the text, “John Kerry’s Daughter Says BILLIONS of Humans Must Die for the ‘New World Order.'”

“So now we know… they are KILLING us with chemicals, shots, food is poisoned.. ENOUGH!!!” the caption reads. (RELATED: No, John Kerry Has Not Called For Depopulation As A Part Of The United Nations’ Agenda 2030)

The claim is baseless, however. There are no credible news reports to suggest Kerry said this. Likewise, the alleged statement could not be found on any of Kerry’s social media accounts.

The image’s text matches a headline from The People’s Voice. A “Liability Disclaimer” included on the site’s “Terms of Use” page indicates it “makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information, software, products, services and related graphics contained on the site for any purpose.” Check Your Fact has debunked claims originating from this site multiple times previously.

Check Your Fact reached out to a Kerry spokesperson for comment and will update this piece accordingly if one is received."

 “The Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.” ( – Joseph Toomey, below)

Talented amateurs are often better than the ‘professionals’ when it comes to dissecting U.S. energy policy. Or maybe I have it reversed. The pros are those in the trenches and the amateurs are the ones on high.

So let’s call Joseph Toomey, independent management consultant, an expert. Here is his recent post about the much-in-the-news problems of the offshore wind industry under Biden Energy Policy.

Not long ago, this thread reiterated a resolute, long-standing belief that Offshore Wind is neither practical nor affordable, even in high-tax Democrat-governed Blue States of the U.S. Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. Four proposed Offshore Wind projects had collapsed into miserable failure after project sponsors demanded increased public subsidies of as much as 65% above the already wildly-inflated feed-in prices they had previously been promised by New York State.

Just this week, it was New Jersey’s turn to be left looking like adolescents for pretending that Offshore Wind could ever become a viable option for supplying the electricity needs of that state’s ratepayers at affordable levels.

Note the delicious fury from New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy who proclaimed that:

“Today’s decision by Ørsted to abandon its commitments to New Jersey is outrageous and calls into question the company’s credibility and competence.”

It was Murphy himself whose competence had been called into question by backing these wildly infeasible ideas.

If this sounds a little too much like a “Spike the Football” moment for our valuable readership, you have my deepest condolences. I just fell off my armchair laughing at the hilarious incompetence of our renewable energy-promoting political class. The day can’t come soon enough when real adults return into leadership positions to pull humanity back from the brink of extinction events that actually exist, as recent troubling global developments adequately demonstrate.

The Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.

The badly-needed adult supervision delivered by marketplace realities has now demonstrated to sentient humans that there was never a chance in the whole universe that Biden’s absurd plan could ever be realized.

Comments on Post

Some of the many comments that followed either confirmed the obvious or suggested the way forward.

The obvious from Robert Borlick: “Notice how many days with no output? This is why wind needs to be backed up with dependable generators that can be ramped up to serve the load.”

The way forward from Ken Urkosky: “All this subsidy funding should go to building infrastructure capable of withstanding the harsher weather events we’re told to expect! That would be much more effective in reducing the impacts of climate change vs trying to control our Earth’s climate.”

And Borlick, an important voice in the electricity debate, has had enough with offshore wind:

I strongly opposed the OSW projects that were approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission in 2017 and again in 2021. Both awards violated Maryland law by not conducting valid cost-benefit analyses, which would have eliminated all but one project (US Wind). I tried to persuade the Maryland People’s Counsel to sue the MPSC but they wimped out – both times.

Now the crazies in the Maryland legislature want to approve even more OSW but this time they want to hide the huge subsidies by paying them out of general tax revenues, instead of through the more visible electricity rate increases.

My hope is that cost increases will kill the Maryland projects just as they did the New Jersey projects.

The last word goes to engineer Greg Gardner: “BUT, it made a lot of congresspersons rich… that was the real plan.”"

Are you ready for your government to tell you that you can only travel a 20-minute radius from home because it’s part of saving the planet from global warming? Scotland’s plan to implement “20-minute neighborhoods” nationwide is almost ready to launch, and have no doubts, it’s just another fancy name for climate lockdowns. No, this is not about the pandemic. This is about the governments of the world attempting to steal more freedoms and rights from their citizens, and if you believe you can save the world by staying near your home and neighborhood, then you most definitely are completely brainwashed by the crooked “system.”


The fake “war on carbon” includes restrictive 20-minute “neighborhoods” monitored by the tyrannical Scottish government and the United Nations

It’s documented already. The Scottish government is prepared for climate lockdowns, where their citizens may never leave their homes again, except to visit the city park (think prison ‘yard’) or the nearby convenient store, then return immediately to house arrest. Every citizen will be treated like a hard criminal, and actually really become one, if the new mandates are broken.

This is all documented under the United Nations’ “Sustainable Development Goals” umbrella policy. That’s because the “Climate Emergency Response Group” is on the scene, ready to save planet earth from the evil car users and restore the temperature back to whatever it was at before cars were invented (the same).

Get ready to “decarbonize” your energy and land use, while surrendering all of your “natural assets” in ways that benefit the “communities” (big government). That’s right, the Scottish government is planning “future places” where people can walk around or drive a few miles to escape their home prisons. This is also called “local living” and “green space” under the UN goal’s documented “National Planning Framework.”

“National Spatial Strategy” spells out “liveable places” and “productive places” meaning work from home and never leave, except for government-supervised local movements

Scotland is just a litmus test for the rest of the world. Have no doubts that once this is implemented and the populace succumbs, it will become a law of the New World Order, run by NATO police and the globalists, to keep the whole world on climate lockdown. This is not a Marvel movie where a few superheroes must save the planet from the sun’s heat bursting all of the humans into flames next month. This is reality, even though the earth is in a slow cooling phase that won’t affect humans for about a million more years. That’s why you should follow the science, not the rogue governments and their insane mandates, if you want to survive this.

Scotland’s Climate Change Plan is focused on achieving “net zero emissions by 2045,” meaning their economy will be completely wrecked, the citizens all starving to death, zero employment outside of working from home off a phone or computer, and total government tyranny. The “need to travel” will be reduced by 20%, periodically, until no person shall leave their home ever again, for anything, in order to save earth from global burning.

No person in Scotland will be allowed to travel more than 20 minutes from their home, and just how soon until even that is reduced to 10, 5, 1, then zero? It’s like when the governments said everyone would have to wear Covid masks for just a couple weeks, to flatten out the curve, then we would all go back to normal. Remember that? How did that work out?"
EN_CC_200211.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Review: ‘The Out-Laws’ is a criminal waste of time 

 LONDON: A producer’s credit for Adam Sandler is not quite the badge of honor it used to be, and nowhere is that more evident than in new Netflix comedy “The Out-Laws.”

This ostensibly funny heist movie stars Adam DeVine as bank manager Owen Browning, a bumbling (yet, the film insists, lovable) dork who suspects that his soon-to-be in-laws might have robbed his bank and then attempted to frame him.

Said in-laws are Billy (Pierce Brosnan) and Lilly (Ellen Barkin), a pair of suave, sophisticated rogues who insist they are definitely not an infamous crime duo known as the Ghost Bandits — spoiler alert, they are — and simply want to prevent their daughter Parker (Nina Dobrev) from marrying a man they see as not good enough.

Owen thinks he can charm anyone, so sets about winning their hearts by getting drunk, jumping out of a plane, and getting a tattoo in a bid to win them over.

Cue a convoluted plot meander which sees Owen teaming up with Billy and Lilly to knock over a rival bank to pay off the Bandits’ debts to a criminal kingpin, and which serves as a jumping-off point for a series of hackneyed jokes about genitalia and inappropriate bodily contact.

Brosnan and Barkin, to their credit, do their best with that they are given, but playing opposite DeVine’s rubber-faced (albeit well-meaning) imbecile would ask a lot of any actors. Michael Rooker seems equally embarrassed as a grizzled FBI agent, but at least Richard Kind and Julie Hagerty bring some laughs as Owen’s strait-laced parents.

Sadly, for every halfway decent joke in the movie (there is a good James Bond quip, at least), there is a plethora of overblown, silly set pieces which trade on the kind of surreal “wackiness” at which Adam Sandler, at the peak of his powers, used to excel.

Unfortunately, for “The Out-Laws,” we are a long way from those heady days, and this flaccid comedy makes you feel every one of its 95 minutes."

 The great Rush Limbaugh once said, “Climate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government.” Well, a solar company in Arizona is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies this year, the overwhelming majority of its operating profit. That’s right. Your tax dollars are working to prop up a toxic and unreliable energy source under the Biden administration.

Here is the full quote from Rush Limbaugh:

Climate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government. It’s all about expanding the government and government control over people. It’s about creating victims. When you successfully turn somebody into a victim, you have automatically made them a dependent on you. You are essentially telling them they have lost the power necessary to solve their own problems. And you create within them a mentality that they can’t overcome their own problem because they’re victims.

This whole paragraph is absolutely true, but I’m going to focus on the first point made. Climate change certainly allows many young people to feel virtuous for engaging in destructive or pointless demonstrations while they claim that the problems in their lives are caused by some vaguely defined climate catastrophe, one which government has to fix for them. Most of all, however, the climate scam is a way of enriching its proponents in government and business.

The Wall Street Journal reported July 31 that Arizona-based solar panel manufacturer First Solar “expects to receive as much as $710 million this year—nearly 90% of forecast operating profit—from subsidies the U.S. government rolled out a year ago to encourage domestic renewables production.” WSJ added, “One analyst estimates the incentives could be worth more than $10 billion for the company over the next decade.” Talk about hitting the jackpot.

From WSJ:

First Solar expects to have as much as a 60% share of the U.S. market for large-scale solar installations this year, largely a result of government policies that are pushing clean-energy developers to buy more made-in-America components.

The company’s shares have more than doubled to $208.40 in Friday trade since the beginning of 2022, despite a string of earnings disappointments during that period.

The manufacturer has even announced a new factory.

What is not being said here is that solar panels generate lots of toxic waste and are unreliable as an energy source. Also, solar panels have killed billions of birds. Meanwhile, huge swathes of natural scenery and farmland must be ruined to set up solar panels. Solar is also unprofitable when left to survive on its own merits; that’s why so many government subsidies are needed. Solar panels are a terrible choice, both for the environment and for the energy grid. They are not a solution to the fake climate crisis.

As the above Limbaugh quote noted, it’s a money-making scam."

“to redefine the relationship between the individual citizen and the state”

“molding humankind’s self conciousness”

sums it pretty much up.

Though it is more humankind’s subconciousness that has been systematically molded with racism,trans,all kind of phobias,climate,viruses,vaccines.

Seems they unleashed a similar number of attacks on mankind

as mankind has unleashed on nature.

(So much that we went from only Gorbatchew sharing Sagans climate anxiety

to 100s of millions of people having been tricked into this anxiety by now)

And this may even be the main reason why the warming nonsense exists –

the equivalent of the needed “Alien attack” to unite(Ronnie must have loved those watchman comics),

which turned these 3 alien

to climate into climate experts.

Especially Sagans take is interessting.

As he and his compatriots used at the same time 10.000s of times higher co2 concentrations(I don’t even dare to imagine this runaway effect and why this effect has been running in the wrong in the wrong direction since then) trying to explain the faint young sun paradox.

I wonder what happened in the meantime that turned a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of co2 into such a behemoth?

And as this text is from before the end of the soviet union one wonders

where and how did Sagan observe all those climate changes that caused him anxietys?

By looking at the stars and all the Ice Age Propaganda of the 70ies?

There was no sea level rise.

Arctic data only existed since 1979

and his buddy Paul Ehrlich he wrote a book with,was an Ice Age Zealot

who already announced the world to end in a blue cloud and mass starvation any time soon.

It is also interessting that once again,out of all countries, the USA is once again is the major player here

and that after the end of the USSR this all somehow resulted in the(typical) looting Russia on a massive scale with the help of Al Gores buddy Larry Summers,USAID and Andrei Shleifer who orchestrated the oligarchic network in Russia – that was later removed and exiled by Putin.

That’s why the US olygarchic complex loves him so much.

(and whatever happened to those close relations with Russia since then?

Seems when a country stops dancing to the US tune and only tries to mind its own business it becomes an enemy)

One also starts to get the idea that the end of the Soviet Union was not some kind of natural development ,but a very deliberate and orchestrated thing.

Pretty much as the current downfall of the USA.

But that’s just a crazy conspiracy theory.

Al Gore, the Joel Osteen of the Church of Warming/Climate, “Pass the plate, I need another jet”

It was always going to be a balancing act keeping the credibility of the global environmental talk shop COP28 in check while holding it in a country where they are producing fossil fuels like it is going out of fashion. It might not have been a wise choice of the UAE’s president Mohamed Bin Zaid to give the top job of presiding over the event to the oil minister and the boss of the national oil company, but it was equally unwise for Sultan al-Jabar to have used the event as a way of promoting the UAE and its oil production to other countries. Something about that smacks of shooting yourself in the foot and perhaps Mr Al Jabar’s denials and feigned innocence at the opening day press conference just made the whole fiasco even more of a farce than it already was.

The UAE tycoon just lowered himself into the vat of sulphuric acid when – in media terms – he couldn’t pull off the ultimate stunt that all politicians dream of but very few actually achieve: to lie to the press and get away with it.

Lazy journalists might have just left it at that. But then they started to look more closely at Mr Al Jaber who had paid Lynton Cosby, the infamous Australian media and political consultant to handle all the PR for the event – and decided that the Emirate minister’s unchecked, feral speaking needed a closer look. It didn’t take much digging to find even more controversy days earlier when he more or less mocked the science behind climate change in defence of fossil fuels, leading many to ask how did the UAE get this gig in the first place and couldn’t its elite have chosen someone with more media elan?

The failure of the event can really be determined by how media were mismanaged from the beginning when the early signs were there back in January when the Guardian launched its first attack against Mr Al Jaber questioning his credentials. That might have been a good indicator that Jaber and his team needed to listen and learn with a serious of crisis management media training sessions which Mr Cosby should have set up and wheeled in the grey haired retired journalists in London to help with the dummy interviews. But presumably, being someone who has enjoyed silencing the press – the UAE has probably one of the most servile press in the world, often with media outlets running front page stories about the elite opening a shopping mall or just repeating one of their tweets – it was little surprise that Jaber believed that the world’s press wouldn’t turn against him. The old story that when you mess up media, you become the story, became the story. Jaber, within a matter of hours, became the focus of attention by journalists who were the to find a good story and didn’t find one from the organised conferences and hullabaloo.

The UAE needs to think much more about international media if it is going to court the attention of the world. Its elite need to wake up and realise that international press whose journalists fly in and leave a few days later are working from a very different hymn sheet than the local expats who work for The National, which despite huffing and puffing and blowing hot for Jaber right from the beginning made no impact whatsoever on global opinion which has written off the event as an unprecedented PR disaster. Indeed, it was Yanis Varoufakis, a media darling and former Greek Finance minister who put it so succinctly on Twitter:

“UN Chief denounces COP28’s President. What did they expect? Appointing Sultan al-Jaber, the head of UAE’s oil company, as Head of COP28 was like appointing the leader of a pack of wolves to preside over a conference on making the world vegan”. The UAE doesn’t have a satire magazine like Private Eye so we won’t pity those who were robbed of the opportunity to lay on the irony hard and thick. But the lessons are there for the royals of the UAE who must be dumbfounded by the calamity of the event and just how much the whole event has become an international laughing stock. Perhaps think about media more next time?"

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has admitted that “climate crisis” prophecies of doom are a hoax.

In a major U-turn, climate alarmist Gates backtracked and confessed that “global warming” does not have apocalyptic consequences.

Gates reportedly told a group of his fellow globalist green agenda advocates that the “climate doom” narrative has now become so exaggerated that the public now sees right through the charade.

The admission from Gates is a major shift for the billionaire who has been a leading proponent of the “climate emergency” narrative.

For years, Gates has been championing the “Net Zero” goals of the unelected bureaucratic and corporate elite.

The “Net Zero” targets, as dictated to global governments by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and United Nations (UN), seek to strip the public of their quality of life in order to eliminate so-called “carbon emissions” by 2050.

However, as Slay News has reported, analysts warn that meeting these unrealistic goals will cost the taxpaying public $75 trillion.

Even after spending $75T, the world will still likely fall far short of the targets by 2050 and the globalists behind the policies will be long gone.

In 2021, Gates previously warned of apocalyptic consequences if the world fails to achieve “zero net carbon emissions” by the year 2050.

He warned the then-host of “Fox News Sunday” Chris Wallace in February 2021:

“The migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war, which was somewhat weather dependent, we’re going to have 10 times as much migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable.

“We won’t be able to farm or go outside during the summer.

“Wildfires, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S. – the droughts – will reduce productivity in the area dramatically.”

Gates went on to say that the loss of life would be greater than even the worst part of the coronavirus pandemic.

“The instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year,” he said.

“If we wait 10 more years it’s not as bad as if we wait 20 or we wait 30, because the temperature just keeps going up,” he said."

 As Biden issued a statement of ""no comment"" before jaunting from one beach vacation in Delaware to his next vacation in Lake Tahoe, locals in and around Lahaina are saying that the true death toll is much, much higher than Maui authorities are reporting.

The actual death toll, according to some locals, is more like 480, with many of the bodies still not recovered or identified.

""The figure is quadruple that of the official number of 111 – and some of the relatives of the victims have been left to uncover the remains of their loved ones themselves due to the glacial progress of the search and recovery operation,"" one report claims.

The shocking video footage below shows authorities in Maui loading bodies onto a refrigerated truck as an extension of local morgues which are now said to be too full to hold any more bodies:

(Related: Were the Maui fires really natural, or were they an act of climate terrorism by radical leftists pushing a deranged global warming narrative?)

The fact that Biden, also known as the ""big guy"" on Hunter's laptop, is saying nothing about Maui and showing no concern at all for the victims there is hardly a surprise, seeing as how his primary focus is on padding the pockets of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine.

If Maui were to be renamed ""Ukraine,"" Biden would surely start pumping billions of taxpayer dollars into its coffers without. He does this without end for Zelensky while actual Americans struggle to survive amid skyrocketing inflation and a collapsing economy.

""One-hundred percent not enough is being done, so people are doing it themselves,"" said Maui local Allisen Medina.

""The government, relief organizations – they're not doing anything. We have the right to know what's going on. FEMA came here to help with the recovery [process], but we don't see them. The Red Cross arrived four days late and they're not doing anything. They're supposed to help and not just stand around.""

""We're only 100 miles from Oahu which has several military bases. Why is the response so lacking? Why are they doing so little? Why is nothing else being done?""

Medina's claims were corroborated by Southwest Airlines stewardess Sarah Trost, who says she spoke with a morgue worker in the Maui area who confirmed to her that the true death count so far is at least 480 people.

Authorities, Trost says, have only searched about 13 percent of the burnt-out area, not 78 percent like they recently falsely claimed.

""He found so many children, children and moms holding each other,"" Trost said in a video she posted to TikTok. ""Infants, toddlers, the unimaginable. Husbands and wives, whole entire [families] in a room just huddling together, burning to death.""

There are also about 1,400 people still missing, whom some believe are dead and gone in the ashes – meaning they are unidentifiable.

""It's all bones,"" Trost said. ""So, he's grabbing the bones with the ash shoveling them into body bags. They have no more room on the island in the morgue so they're shipping in containers to hold those body bags.""

In the comments, someone wrote that he suspects the true number of dead is more like 4,800, seeing as how the population of Lahaina before the fires was around 12,216 (as of 2020).

There does not appear to be anything natural about the Maui fires. Learn more at FalseFlag.news.

Tommy Tuberville: “Climate Change is the Biggest Hoax in the World!… I Would Say “25% of Budget” Goes to It (VIDEO) 

 Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville joined Steve Bannon on The War Room on Friday following Joe Biden’s incredibly partisan and completely dishonest State of the Union Address to the American people last night in Washington DC.

During their discussion, Tommy was asked about the climate change craze. The former Auburn coach did not hold back. Tuberville told the War Room audience, “Climate Change is the biggest hoax in the world.” He then added that he believes around 25% of the budget is dumped into climate change policies.

There are obviously a whole lot of grifters getting rich of the “hoax.”

The Democrat Party and their mainstream media will not be pleased with Tommy following his honest assessment of the international scam.

Steve Bannon: Okay, so you’re a common sense guy, right? Big education guy. You’ve been around universities all your life. When you come and hear the presentations, when they come and present to you, is it nonsense? I mean, is it just voodoo?

Sen. Tuberville: Oh, the climate, yeah. Oh, it’s biggest hoax in the world. I mean, it’s all a money grab… We come in here at our budgets about near 5 trillion a year. What we run on, we’ve spent since I’ve been here, and I hadn’t voted for any of $7 trillion more than that since we’ve been here. Right. I would say 25% of that, Steve, has gone to climate change. I mean, it is the biggest hoax in the world. I mean, you’ve got this clown Kerry. That John Kerry. He doesn’t know what day it is most of the time. I think he’s right behind Joe Biden, and he’s pushed this narrative along with these money grabbers like Clinton and Gore and all the Democrats. I mean, it is all a money grab. This EV car system, you’re seeing it now. It’s crashing, crashing, burning. They can’t get anything out of the solar, no wind…

…I lived in West Texas, coach at university at Texas Tech. I had a wind turbine, huge one, in my backyard, a couple hundred yards. You could hear it going around…

…But if the wind’s not blowing on that turbine behind me, it’s got an electric generator running it. Yeah, that’s fueled by gas and oil. You just have to take a deep breath sometimes and see how deep of hole these people have dug themselves.

Steve Bannon: Have they presented you any information or data or analysis that would make you say, some of this climate change stuff might be logical, or is it just all presented as essentially financial, economic voodoo?

Sen. Tuberville: Yeah, they don’t know enough about it. Now, you can get some of these big scientists who come in and try to push, but you look at the graphs and the narratives that they bring in… It’s a hoax. I’m telling you, it is a huge hoax. We’re all for our air, our water, taking care of what we do, but they’re making money off this. And again, that’s the Democrat party. They want to make money off everything they do."

 Bad luck for solar panel owners and users, and anything relying on photosynthesis. But as such umbrellas would be far too heavy to move even if they could be made, probably nothing to worry about. Just another climate alarm concoction in search of funding.

– – –

A team of climate scientists wants to launch enormous umbrellas into space to reduce the Earth’s exposure to the sun and fight climate change, The New York Times reported Friday (via Climate Change Dispatch).

The underlying idea is that large parasols could be positioned in space such that they marginally reduce the intensity of sunlight the Earth receives and thereby mitigate some global warming, the Times reported.

To block out enough radiation, a single sunshade would need to be approximately the size of Argentina — nearly one million square miles — and would weigh about 2.5 million tons, so scientists are looking to prove the idea could work by first producing a 100-square foot prototype with the help of $10 to $20 million of funding.

Dr. Yoram Rozen, a physics professor and the Asher Space Research Institute’s director at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, is leading the team of scientists pushing the idea, according to the Times.

Because the Argentina-sized umbrella would be too large to feasibly launch into space, his team is hoping to build a set of smaller shades that would diffuse the intensity of the radiation reaching the planet.

“We can show the world, look, there is a working solution, take it, increase it to the necessary size,” Rozen told the Times.

Rozen and his team are still designing the prototype, but they anticipate that they could build it within about three years once they get the required funds [Talkshop comment – of course], according to the Times.

A full-sized product would cost trillions of dollars, and that expense would likely have to be picked up by many countries (i.e., their taxpayers), Rozen told the Times.

 Under the guise of 'fighting climate change,' the regime has now proposed new regulations that target some of the most commonly used household appliances, including dishwashers. According to Fox Business, the Department of Energy has proposed new rules that would reduce the current limits for water and energy use in dishwashers.

The proposed rules would limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, significantly lower than the current limit of 5 gallons, and manufacturers would need to reduce their products’ energy consumption by almost 30 percent. Even though most dishwashers available on the market already meet or exceed the current federal standards, the proposed rules have left some questioning why the Biden administration is focusing on such regulations rather than other priorities.

“Dishwashers are not the only appliances Biden’s DOE has set its sights on, however, as the regulator is also considering crackdowns on washers, dryers and refrigerators that manufacturers say could reduce performance,” Fox Business noted further.

Members of the regime have been clear: The rule changes pertain to Biden’s ‘climate agenda.’

“Collectively these energy efficiency actions … support President Biden’s ambitious clean energy agenda to combat the climate crisis,” the DOE wrote earlier this year.

“This Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated in a Friday news release.

Critics have also poked major holes in the regime's claim that the new rules are going to save American consumers oodles of money each year.

“The department estimates that consumers will save $3 billion over the next 30 years, or $100 million per year, on their utility bills thanks to the rougher rules,” Christian Britschgi wrote at Reason. “That’s a pretty small per capita savings when spread across the 89 million dishwasher-owning households.”

In fact, he noted that the new rules actually might lead to more water use:

The new regulations might lead to more water usage as individuals switch to washing dishes by hand, Britschgi pointed out, citing research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).

The think tank’s proposal led President Donald Trump’s administration to approve a new class of dishwashers that clean dishes in one hour, though Biden’s team repealed the pro-consumer regulatory agenda of his predecessor.

The proposed dishwasher regulations follow a recent debate over gas stoves at the national level. Despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s reassurances that there is nothing to be concerned about, just last week his home state of New York prohibited gas stoves.

“Nobody is taking away your gas stove,” Schumer tweeted in early February. “Shameless and desperate MAGA Republicans are showing us they will cook up any distraction to divert from real issues the American people want solved, like the debt ceiling.”

That turned out to be 100 percent false, obviously.

“Nevertheless, New York lawmakers agreed to ban gas stove hookups in all future buildings in late April. The ban will affect new construction on small buildings in 2025 and move on to larger buildings by 2028,” Fox Business added.

In a statement last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr., a Democratic activist and labor union leader, suggested that stoves could pose a “hidden hazard” to users and that ""any option is on the table."" However, after receiving backlash, Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric clarified that the agency had no plans to ban stoves.

But in February, the Energy Department went ahead with a new proposal that would allow government regulators to write energy consumption standards for the appliances, the Daily Wire reported.

 DeSantis brags his climate change plan is scrap Biden’s

Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis says if elected president his plan to address climate change will be to throw out President Joe Biden’s Green New Deal.

Last week on Monday planet Earth suffered the hottest day on record, a record that it broke on Tuesday.

Fox News Business’ Stuart Varney, who has attacked climate change activists as “juvenile” and declared it is “ridiculous” that “the western world is obsessed with climate change,” on Monday asked DeSantis if he has a plan to address the climate crisis.

“The headlines are just full of stories about wildfires smoke, extraordinary temperatures in the southwest and the Southeast to some degree. Do you have a climate plan?” Varney asked.

“It’s going to be to rip up Joe Biden’s Green New Deal,” DeSantis bragged. “I think at the end of the day, we need to embrace American domestic energy. This could be a huge source of national security, economic vitality can build our industrial base in Florida.”

DeSantis’ claim echoes Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy‘s, who last Thursday said God has blessed America with large natural gas resources, and the United States should use them to make two of the world’s largest countries and largest economies, China and India, “dependent on American natural gas.” He suggested doing so would “make us economically stronger but geopolitically the world safer,” while falsely claiming it would make the world “environmentally sound.”

The Florida governor bragged to Varney about Florida’s reduction in emissions, which happened, he admitted, through “market forces.”

“We’ve actually had a huge reduction in emissions but it was done through innovation,” DeSantis said. “It was done through market forces, not command and control. So we’ll go about that in a much different direction than, than Joe Biden, I think ultimately, Biden’s policies and Bidenomics is really about making the average person poor and reducing their standard of living. That is not the way you go about it.”

Last year, a Tampa Bay Times opinion piece noted, “2018, the last year for which [emissions] data is available, Florida utilities had decreased emissions by 19%, the research shows, while tailpipe emissions grew 12%.”

DeSantis was sworn into office in 2019.

Also last year, the Miami Herald warned Florida was not addressing the causes of climate change.

“The last time the Legislature addressed the root cause of climate change — greenhouse gas emissions — it was in a law that effectively blocked cities from cutting emissions,” the paper reported.

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

A recent study has concluded that globalist claims of “manmade climate change” are completely fabricated and have no basis in reality.

The researchers found that there is no scientific evidence to support theories of anthropogenic “global warming.”

According to the study, led by leading scientists in Greece, claims that humans cause “climate change” are based on imagination and assumptions.

The study’s paper, authored by lead researcher Professor Demetris Koutsoyiannis of the National Technical University of Athens, was published in the scientific journal AIMS Press.

In the “Conclusions” section of the study’s paper, the researchers write:

“Rather, such claims are based on imagination and climatic models full of assumptions.

“However, as shown in the causality direction in time series produced by climatic models is opposite to that of the real-world data.”

The study found that the narrative of human-generated carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions affecting temperatures is based on fake science.

In the “Abstract” section of the paper, Koutsoyiannis notes:

“The premise of this study is that the climatic system is very complex and subject to perpetual change due to numerous processes, either internal or external to it.”

“The fact that one of them, namely the relationship of climate with atmospheric CO2, is highlighted in the last decades does not correspond to its actual importance as a climate driver.

“The promoted importance is a non-scientific issue, related to the narrative that humans, through their emissions by fossil fuel burning, are responsible for the changes we see in climate.”

The study stated that, under the guise of science, the propagation of the anti-CO2 narrative is being driven by political and economic forces."

 In 1954, the US Congress renamed Armistice Day to Veterans Day. The stated reason was to remember all generations of US veterans, not just veterans from the First World War. Congress advanced this rationale on the disingenuous notion that Armistice Day’s purpose was a celebration of veterans. It was not. Armistice Day’s purpose was to serve as a reminder of the horrors of the First World War and carry forward the declaration of those veterans of Never Again.

For a US government implementing a militarized Cold War foreign policy in 1954, a reconciliation-based holiday was inconvenient and problematic. A holiday celebrating veterans would present no critique of war or advocacy of peace; it would do the opposite. As we have seen repeatedly since 1954, Veterans Day and other aspects of “support the troops” rhetoric have been used to shout down dissent towards American wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq and suppress criticism of America’s massive overseas military empire and gargantuan Pentagon budgets. The veneration of veterans, almost always obligatorily referred to as heroes, became quasi-deification. In my life, I have seen my military service elevated to near clerical levels, reflecting a pseudo-religious treatment of America’s military caste, best exemplified by the reflexive and ritual-like statements of “thank you for your service.” The political calculus behind the name change was correct.

The militarized foreign policy of the Cold War did not just remain when the Cold War ended but became turbo-charged. The results of that militarized foreign policy have been disastrous for US national security and worldwide stability. The tremendous suffering of entire nations of people, as well as American veterans and their families, cannot be overstated.

Our celebration of war that accompanies each annual Veterans Day is reflected yearlong through our politics, news media, Hollywood, and education system. The consequences of this militarization do not stop with the death and destruction from the instability and wars but include the growth of a ravenous military-industrial complex, a Leviathan, at the expense of our economy and society. With 60% of the federal discretionary budget going to the Pentagon, military contractors and to pay the costs of past wars, the opportunity costs to American communities who are told there is not enough money for healthcare, education, environmental protection and other needs are severe.

That change from Armistice Day to Veterans Day in 1954 signaled a conversion of the American government and its purposes. While the US was an empire before the Second World War, the victory in 1945 created an America that was The Empire. We have been reaping the consequences of that transformation ever since.

Imagine what would be now if, rather than policies derived from a jingoistic narrative of good wars and honorable slaughters, we had preceded with the wisdom of those men from 1918 and followed their admonition of Never Again. Returning to Armistice Day would not simply restore the holiday’s original name but would signal a commitment to peace, stability, prosperity, and hope for future generations. As we endure veteran suicide epidemics, bear a hollow economy and fragile communities, witness our government direct and contribute to the great and unholy carnage in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, and recognize the twin existential catastrophes of nuclear war and climate change, what Armistice Day can represent does not sound simply aspirational but entirely necessary."

 It turns out that the green climate agenda is a ploy, or Trojan Horse, to let the enemy inside the gate to put all family farmers out of business; destroy the tradition of animal husbandry; and promote the worldwide consumption of insects rather than meat – for the non-elite, of course, since those at the top of the pyramid still plan to gorge on meat and the finest of the fine when it comes to all things fancy and gourmet.

It is you and I whom the globalists want to be stuck in chains eating cockroaches and crickets for dinner every night while we celebrate the ""happiness"" of owning absolutely nothing and somehow being happy about it – how is that supposed to work?

(Related: Did you catch the news that South Pole, the world's leading seller of so-called ""carbon credits,"" is no longer operational because it was all just a scam from the very beginning?)

In his documentary film ""No Farmers No Food,"" EpochTV host Roman Balmakov, the film's maker, discusses how an army of climate activists is being groomed by corrupt governments into shutting down all food-producing farms because said farms are ""destroying the planet,"" we are told.

Instead, the powers that be want these farms to be replaced by bug factories like the kinds billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates is starting to build across the tens of millions of United States farm acreage he has been gobbling up in recent years.

""People in charge of some of the most powerful organizations on the planet have determined that agriculture, specifically animal agriculture, is to blame for global warming, and global warming is to blame for the high prices of food and food shortages,"" Balmakov says about who he believes is behind the green agenda.

By now, you have probably heard about the farmer protests in The Netherlands, which have spread to the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, and elsewhere as green politicians in these areas push to outlaw traditional farming due to the ""carbon"" it produces.

In other areas such as California, green bureaucrats are taking a slightly different approach by simply depriving farmers of the water they need to grow food for the nation and world. By creating constant artificial scarcity of water through ""droughts"" (i.e., flagrant water mismanagement), the narrative can be spun that we are running out of water and thus must stop eating meat.

We are already seeing the consequences of all this green meddling in the form of sky-high food prices and food shortages, and what will soon become widespread famine and mass starvation.

Truth be told, the ever-so-slight ""warming"" that one can, in a way, argue has been occurring – the earth goes through warming and cooling phases all the time, a simple fact check shows – has actually helped the planet by making it more green in a literal sense with more plants and improved crop yields.

The greenies are always lying about this, though. They want us to believe that unless we get rid of all meat, gas-powered cars, and industry, the ecosystems of the planet are going to collapse. This is a lie that must constantly be refuted, or else you had better start getting used to cockroach curry, mosquito marinades, and fly flakes in your pantry."

Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama are holding back-to-back democracy conferences in the days after Donald Trump makes what he’s teased will be a major announcement.

Trump advisor Jason Miller confirmed Trump’s “big” announcement will be the former president declaring his 2024 candidacy, an announcement some Republicans have been pushing for Trump to hold off on making. Miller at one point even said he advised Trump to wait until the Georgia runoff election between Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Republican Herschel Walker.

Axios reported on Saturday that organizers insist Bush and Obama did not coordinate the timing of their conferences, both of which will focus on “highlighting rising threats from authoritarianism and disinformation — and how to combat them globally and at home,” according to the outlet.

Bush’s conference will take place in Dallas on November 16, while Obama’s will be in New York on November 17. Bush will interview Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at his conference."

 The truth that IPCC and NOAA do not want people to know includes the fact that CO2 breaks down into three different molecules when combined with water. These molecules are collectively known as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and one of them includes bicarbonate ions that comprise more than 90 percent of the ocean's current.

Carbonate ions comprise about nine percent of DIC, leaving invading CO2 levels at no more than one percent, which is inconsequential. This means that IPCC and NOAA are lying about CO2 acidifying the world's oceans when ocean waters actually contain less than one percent CO2.

It must also be noted that the other 99-plus percent of bicarbonate and carbonate ions that CO2 turns into when mixing with ocean water actually creates a buffer that prevents ocean water from acidifying. This creates what is essentially distilled water throughout ocean currents.

(Related: In 2021, a handful of scientist whistleblowers exposed ocean acidification as just another climate hoax designed to fool the masses into supporting more green tyranny.)

One of the other myths being spread by IPCC and NOAA involves the false claim that acidified ocean water, supposedly caused by too much CO2, is causing the shells of ocean creatures to dissolve. This simply cannot be true for the simple fact that ocean creatures with shells have protective coatings that prevent dissolution.

The same is true for coral polyps, which have special protection that guards their reef skeletons against being eroded through acidification. And ocean water is actually more protective than distilled water at keeping these shells intact to begin with, which makes climate claims to the contrary simply ridiculous.

""Shells and reefs are made of calcium carbonate,"" writes Jim Steele. ""The hoax abuses one true scientific factoid: At a lower pH, the added H+ ions will re-join with the ocean's buffering carbonate ions.""

""That reduces sea water's available carbonate ions by converting them to bicarbonate ion. So, alarmists' falsely claim acidification will reduce seawater's carbonate ions, making it more difficult to make calcium carbonate shells or reefs.""

Part of the climate hoax suggests that ocean shells and reefs import carbonate ions directly from seawater, but that too much CO2 inhibits this. All available evidence shows that shells and reefs only import CO2 and abundant bicarbonate ions, which are then converted internally to a carbonate ion.

In other words, CO2 from the atmosphere mixes with ocean water and turns into the exact ingredients that shells and reefs need to build strength and resiliency. CO2 actually helps them, not hurts them like the climate cult falsely claims.

The newly converted carbonate ions that result internally from CO2 mixing into water combines with calcium to form the calcium carbonate building blocks needed for reef skeletons and shells.

""Thus, any acidification that converts sea water carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions is actually helping reefs and shell-making which only absorb the critical CO2 and bicarbonate ions,"" Steele further explains.

""Knowing the real science, I can no longer trust the IPCC or NOAA's acidification alarmism misinformation.""

Further debunking the ocean acidification myth is the fact that the CO extracted from water, both salt and fresh, by coral, mollusks and other sea life ends up becoming chalk, limestone and marble.

""Amazingly, despite what we are told, the oceans are not boiling and one can still pick up seashells at the seashore,"" one commenter wrote, adding to this sentiment."

 You see, the EV scam was hastily hatched by far-leftists who are so detached from reality that they actually believe it is possible to just stop using earth-based fossil fuels on some arbitrary timeline with nothing viable to replace them.

Not only that, but ""green"" enthusiasts seem to lack the cognition necessary to see that there is no workable infrastructure in place to even accommodate the use of EVs as a total replacement for cars with internal combustion engines.

""The mass conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs) to electric vehicles was never more than a Democrat / environmentalist hallucination anyway,"" says Dr. Ron Ross, PhD.

""It was the most ill-conceived government policy objective in modern history. The transition should have been a nonstarter. It's riddled with numerous deal killers. It's like having a dozen fatal diseases all at the same time.""

(Related: Learn more about why EVs have been a scam from the very beginning.)

In a piece he wrote for the Climate Change Dispatch that was also picked up by Climate Depot, Ross explains at great length what would need to be in place just to create the possibility that a nationwide fleet of 100 percent EVs would work.

For one, energy generation and grid expansion would need to at least double, and very quickly. With the arbitrary deadlines the greenies have put in place, one of the big ones being Agenda 2030, that type of rapid expansion is simply impossible.

There is a reason why there was never any market research or feasibility studies done on the EV transition. Had they been, the results would have shown what we are now all finding out in real time: that EVs are a lost cause.

""The electric vehicle honeymoon is over,"" Ross contends. ""Don't expect the marriage itself to last much longer either.""

Another thing the greenies never considered is the lengthy charging times for EVs. While a gas-powered vehicle can be refilled with gas at any one of the tens of thousands of gas stations that dot the United States landscape, EVs take hours to charge – assuming you can even find a charger.

Someone with an EV who lives in California, for instance, would not even make it through Arizona, let alone all the way through Texas, if they were, say, taking a road trip to Florida.

""Did they truly believe everyone would tolerate spending hours to charge their vehicles rather than the minutes they were accustomed to?"" Ross asks.

Sales data clearly shows that the American public is simply not interested, either due to cost or impracticality, in buying an EV. Heck, even car rental companies are having trouble getting their customers to rent an EV for a day or two, let alone buy one.

Even so, car manufacturers are continuing to ramp up EV production. This means that, in time, there will be EV graveyards full of unsold EVs, resulting in untold billions of dollars in losses and serious economic repercussions.

 The Royal College of Physicians has abandoned science, and become a green ideological campaigning organisation.

The RCP’s “green physician toolkit” is precisely the same patronising nonsense as the WHO’s toolkit of the same name, discussed in my Daily Sceptic article a few months ago.

The two main ideas behind the toolkit are

a) that doctors routinely make “unnecessary” decisions that have environmental impact, and that

b) they should use their authority to advance an ideological agenda.

For example “reduce blood testing where clinically appropriate”. This assumes that doctors test people’s blood frivolously, something equivalent to an “unnecessary journey”. Very, very odd.

But the most egregious claim, of course, is that “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to human health”.

That is so far from truthful, and so utterly embedded in green ideology, that the word “lie” is not sufficient.

There is less than zero evidence that climate is a “threat to human health”, let alone the “biggest threat”. The evidence debunking the link between climate change and health is so strong that doctors have to go out of their way to conceal the stats.

You can see the raw data here for yourself. Climate-related mortality has fallen in recent decades. Diseases of poverty, which are claimed to be climate-linked, including malaria, are also in steep decline.

I give an overview of how climate-activist doctors at the Lancet are influenced by ideology here, and go into more detail to explain how they lie in this presentation below. At around 36 mins, I show that the Lancet’s green propaganda pages hide the mortality statistics behind “frequency of event” statistics, to give the opposite impression.

The Lancet claims that “life-threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent”. When you interrogate the data, however, it reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather.

So it’s not just a lie, it’s a fraud. And it’s a fraud told for political effect, to transform society and the economy, which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health. And it already is, if we calculate the opportunity cost for people in emerging economies.

Doctors and medical researchers involved in this propaganda have invented their own metric of “risk” to create “evidence” of a growing “threat”. And doctors and institutions of medicine that reproduce this propaganda do so *uncritically* without checking the numbers.

The numbers are not complicated. The science is not complicated. The data is not hard to find. This is not like 5-sigma high energy physics experimentation.

Consider this chart from the latest Lancet propaganda report, for example. It claims that the better part of a $trillion is lost from agricultural production because of exposure to heat. But look at how small that effect is in the West, compared to developing/low income economies.

Whereas farmers in the US can tend to vast farms, sitting in GPS-guided, air conditioned, diesel-powered tractors, subsistence agriculture is dawn-to-dusk manual labour.

The difference is access to fossil fuels. It’s not a weather or climate effect.

To frame that disparity between agricultural producers in the richest and poorest economies as one of “climate change”, requiring the abolition of fossil fuels is a grotesque injustice. It is vile."

EurekAlert news release: Climate: Increasing tropical cyclone frequency may have deadly consequences for seabird populations

The increase in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity due to climate change could lead to dramatic declines in seabird populations, suggests a paper published in Communications Earth & Environment.

The authors’ conclusion is based on the impacts of Cyclone Ilsa on Bedout Island, after the cyclone killed at least 80% of seabirds nesting on the island when it struck in April 2023.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones.

Individual cyclones can have a dramatic impact on wildlife populations, including seabirds. Cyclones directly affect seabirds in several ways, including causing significant mortality events, disrupting their nesting and breeding patterns, and altering migration strategies.

The increasing frequency of cyclones is already known to have negative impacts on a range of organisms, but the impact on seabird populations is still unclear.

Jennifer Lavers and colleagues studied the impact of Cyclone Ilsa, a category 5 tropical cyclone, on the populations of several seabird species breeding on the 17-hectare Bedout Island, Western Australia, after the cyclone crossed the island on April 13 2023.

They used aerial and ground surveys, conducted between April 17 and July 21 2023, to estimate the percentage mortality of three species — the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), the lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), and an endemic subspecies of the masked booby (Sula dactylatra bedouti).

The authors estimate that 80–90% of these species’ populations — at least 20,000 individual birds — were killed during the storm, with the losses predominantly adult breeding birds.

The authors warn that this level of population loss for island seabirds may be unsustainable when coupled with the increase in cyclone frequency, as many seabirds are long-lived, have long generation times, and raise very few chicks per year.

 COP28 President: There Is ""No Science"" Behind Calls For Fossil-Fuel Phase-Out

There is “no science” that says the world should phase out fossil fuels to curb global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate summit, the Guardian and the Centre for Climate Reporting report.

“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” Al Jaber said in an online event last month, the remarks from which the Guardian reported on December 3, days after the COP28 summit in Dubai began on November 30.

Al Jaber made those comments in response to questions from Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders group and a former UN special envoy for climate change.

[ZH: Additionally, The Guardian newspaper published video from the call on Sunday, which included al-Jaber off-camera sounding increasingly frustrated, at one point telling three leading women involved with climate change and gender: ""I am telling you I am the man in charge.”

“You’re asking for a phase-out of fossil fuel,"" al-Jaber said.

""Please, help me, show me for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.”

Responding to the remark, U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she lives in Kenya with solar power and clean electricity from the local utility.

“I'm not living in a cave,"" she added.

""That's all I can say.”

The remarks from Al Jaber draw criticism from scientists and are in contrast with the view of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said at the climate summit on Friday,

“The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.”

Al Jaber’s presidency of COP28 has stirred controversy in recent months. He is the first CEO designated to be president of any climate summit so far. But he is also the chief executive of the national oil company of OPEC's third-largest producer, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

“The recent comments from COP28 President show how entrenched he is in fossil fuel fantasy and is clearly determined that this COP doesn’t do anything to harm the interests of the oil and gas industry,"" said Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa.

“These remarks are a wake-up call to the world and negotiators at COP28 that they are not going to get any help from the COP presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase-out and will need to work hard to ensure a few petro-state leaders don’t imperil the planet in their efforts to protect their oil profits.""

Last week, Al Jaber denied reports of plans to use the climate summit in Dubai to push oil deals.

Earlier last week, the BBC and many other news outlets reported that the UAE planned to use its role as the host of climate talks to forge new oil and gas deals. The BBC cited leaked briefing documents obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC. Those documents were purportedly prepared by the UAE’s COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments during the climate summit which Dubai will host from November 30 to December 12."

 Hypocrisy: COP28 set to break carbon emissions records amid surge in attendee turnout

Experts have raised concerns that COP28 might set a new record for carbon emissions due to the unprecedented number of participants flying into Dubai.

The event, scheduled from November 30 to December 12, anticipates around 400,000 visitors, including 97,000 individuals who have registered as official delegates and will have access to the ""Blue Zone"" reserved for accredited government representatives and corporate entities, the Daily Mail reports.

This figure marks a significant increase from the 49,704 delegates at COP27 in Egypt and 38,457 at the 2021 conference in Scotland. Since 2019, the attendance has nearly tripled. The previous conference in Glasgow was already a record-setter, generating about 102,500 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the annual emissions of 8,000 British citizens.

With the substantial turnout expected in the UAE, there are concerns that COP28 might continue this trend of rising carbon footprints at climate conferences.

Richard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, commented to The Telegraph that this event is likely to have the highest carbon footprint so far.

Originally a modest event in the mid-1990s with about 5,000 attendees, the COP conference has grown significantly, now expecting around 80 times that number. This includes both the open Green Zone, where organizations can showcase their climate actions and the secure Blue Zone, designated for official delegates and negotiations.

However, this expansion raises concerns about the conference's own environmental impact. A significant portion of the emissions, as seen in Glasgow, comes from international flights. Additionally, the logistical needs for housing, security, and transportation for such a large number of participants add to the carbon footprint.

Amid these concerns, there was criticism when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, along with other high-profile figures, chose to travel to the summit by private jet, with Downing Street defending the decision, emphasizing the importance of strong UK participation in the summit.

It also stated that the government's stance is not against flying but focuses on investing in new technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting, asserting that it seeks to lead in climate action without imposing flight restrictions.

This year, Graham Stuart, the Tory MP and Minister of State for Climate, will be heading the UK delegation at COP28.

In November, Stuart emphasized the importance of gradually reducing and eventually eliminating the ""unabated"" use of fossil fuels in the UK, while also noting that there is ""nothing fundamentally wrong with oil and gas.""

EN_CC_200327.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"uk/DeBunked: Spiked's Ella Whelan on Oil and Renewables 


Spiked columnist Ella Whelan made misleading claims about North Sea oil and renewable energy on a recent BBC Question Time.

Here is the evidence for why she’s wrong – and Spiked’s record of climate science denial and fossil fuel funding.

Spiked was introduced as a “non-conformist” outlet on BBC Question Time. In fact it’s a libertarian publication with a history of climate denial and opposing green policies. E.g. In 2018 Spiked published “The Myth of a Climate Crisis” by denier Ben Pile.

Spiked claims to be independent, but between 2015-18 the website received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.

On BBC Question Time, Whelan suggested the UK government invest in “new exploration of North Sea oil” to grow the economy.

This statement ignores fossil fuels’ role driving climate impacts and the associated financial risks.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says any new fossil fuel extraction projects are incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C.

Climate change is already hurting the world economy. Under current policies climate change impacts are projected to cost the UK 7.4 percent of GDP by 2100. Meanwhile, the growing net zero sector employs 850,000 people and is adding £71 billion in Gross Value Added to the UK economy.

Whelan also claimed “wind turbines and solar panels are not going to keep us warm”. In fact, heat pumps, which are powered by electricity, are considered the greenest and most efficient way to heat homes with no need for oil or gas.

Her claim also plays on a common falsehood that wind and solar power are unreliable. In fact in winter 2022, renewables provided more UK electricity than gas power stations: 27 percent of UK electricity was generated by wind, and wind and solar were the EU’s top power source.

The National Grid has said the UK can switch to a 100 percent renewable grid led by wind and solar energy.

In the past, Whelan has claimed to care about climate change, for example in a 2022 interview with TalkTV. But she has also attacked – and misrepresented – efforts to do something about it.

In the same interview, Whelan said the “deluded idea of Net Zero” would mean a “dystopian” scenario in which “people have less, be more miserable, not heat your home, not eat what you want, not travel”.

These critiques are familiar “climate delay narratives”, which paint green action as disruptive and are not a true reflection of plans to reach net zero set out by the UK’s independent Climate Change Committee (CCC), or any other government policy. They also ignore the urgent need to cut emissions and transition to green energy.

Spiked writers like Ella Whelan are frequently hosted on mainstream media without mention of the publication’s history of climate denial and fossil fuel funding.

We hope this thread helps inform future media appearances by Spiked columnists, so that their claims can be challenged with evidence. See more in Spiked’s DeSmog profile here."

 The Met Office has been unable to back up a claim that storms in the U.K. are “more intense” due to the effects of climate change. The claim was made by senior Met Office meteorologist Claire Nasir on January 22nd on BBC 5 Live Breakfast in the aftermath of Storm Isha, and led to a freedom of information request for an explanation by investigative journalist Paul Homewood. The Met Office has replied that it is unable to answer the request due to the fact that the information “is not held”.

In fact the Met Office could have addressed the claim that storms are growing in intensity by referring to its own ‘State of the Climate 2022’ report:

The most recent two decades have seen fewer occurrences of maximum gust speeds above these thresholds [40/50/60 knots] than during previous decades, particularly comparing the period before and after 2000. This earlier period [before 2000] also included among the most severe storms experienced in the U.K. in the observational records including the ‘Burns Day Storm’ of January 25th 1990, the ‘Boxing Day Storm’ of December 26th 1998 and the ‘Great Storm’ of October 16th 1987. Any comparison of storms is complex as it depends on severity, spatial extent and duration. Storm Eunice [in 2022] was the most severe storm to affect England and Wales since February 2014, but even so, these storms of the 1980s and 1990s were much more severe.

An explanation for the remarks broadcast unchallenged on the BBC was provided by the Met Office, “in order to provide advice and assistance”. The statement about more intense storms being due to climate change was, the Met Office explains, in reference to “our published U.K. Climate Projections, looking at projections in the future”. This is straight out laughable, since it seeks to justify a statement firmly in the present with waffle about future modelled projections. Paul Homewood comments that it is “small wonder that so many have little confidence in the Met Office anymore”. Meanwhile, the Global Warming Policy Foundation has demanded that the Met Office retracts the “false ‘more intense storms’ claim”. The foundation notes that there is no compelling trend in maximum gust speeds recorded in the U.K. since 1969.

Of course these remarks by Claire Nasir are just the latest in a long line of scares that are being spread by state-funded operations promoting the collectivist Net Zero project. In the mainstream media there is little or no push back on often outrageous and improbable claims of climate collapse and potential future human misery.

In December, the headlines were full of the news that London could suffer an endemic dengue plague by 2060 due to changes in the climate. The claim from the Health Security Agency arose from a computer model fed with an implausible rise in temperature of 3-4°C within 80 years. Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, called the claims “entirely fictional” and “shameless”. Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch commented that science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. “This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute,” he said.

 A group of mostly unelected globalist oligarchs met in December and decided, for the third decade in a row, to stretch the truth about their efforts to fight “climate change” by cutting fossil fuel emissions.

Unelected representatives from almost 200 countries flew to Dubai in December (on their private jets) to discuss how us poors are ruining their planet by using gas stoves and the like, Reuters reported, using far more diplomatic terms. These “representatives” at Dubai’s COP28 summit decided to unite in putting an end to fossil fuels … literally the same thing they’ve said they wanted to do since the Kyoto Protocol of December 1997.

The Kyoto Protocol was one of the first annual “summits” held by unelected Bond villains who want to decide our fate. At the time, the countries present decided to cut fossil fuel use around the world, lest we be dead or drowning within a decade or two, which turned out to be a lie.

Almost 30 years later, these idiots still think they deserve a big annual party to celebrate the hoax that they’re doing a damn thing to help our species work in symbiosis with the natural environment.

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber had the audacity to call their latest deal “historic.” This deal is only historic because it’s been repeated for the last 26 years, and yet nothing has ever come of it. Why? Because even if what the left said about climate change was true, there would be nothing we could do to stop the runaway process of an ever-evolving global ecosystem. (RELATED: Microchipping Your Child? ‘There Are Solid Rational Reasons For It,’ Say Supreme Overlords Of The WEF)

But the funniest comment of the week came from Norway’s minister of Foreign Affairs, Espen Barth Eide, who said: “It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels.” It is literally the 26th time such an agreement has been made. And guess what happened after all the other agreements?

Absolutely nothing, other than our freedoms being removed without our consent. These people are a joke, and I don’t even know if they realize how blatantly they’re blatantly spreading propaganda. Perhaps they actually think we’re stupid enough to believe them? If so, what does that say about us?"

 Is the U.S. experiencing record heat this summer? Nope. That’s just the propaganda that the climate alarmists would like you to believe. But Marxists often use global warming as an excuse to restrict liberties and confiscate property rights.

Data that hasn’t been manipulated by climate alarmists shows that this summer hasn’t seen a record heatwave across the U.S. There is no climate crisis, no man-made climate Armageddon, so why keep pushing the narrative? Because it’s a wonderfully self-righteous veneer for greedy, tyrannical, freedom-hating Marxism. Don’t fall for the propaganda, but be vigilant. The most vocal climate alarmists have a hidden — and dangerous — agenda.

For instance, the Biden administration doesn’t promote toxic “green” energy or target gas stoves and gas-powered vehicles to save the planet. These are schemes to make money or make citizens poorer and less independent.

Chris Martz of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow’s (CFACT) posted data on June 26 to explain that evidence does not support the “record heat”/global warming claim:

Despite claims from the climate spin doctors that last week's heatwave was “unprecedented,” not one state set a new “all-time” high temperature record… A total of 39 states recorded their “all-time” June high temperature records thirty or more years ago. Of those 39, 31 were set prior to 1960 and 28 prior to 1950. Six states recorded their June “all-time” record highs each in 1934, 1936 and 2012, while five were set each in the years 1919, 1931 and 1994.

The Desert Southwest has yet to see a heatwave that is as intense as that of late-June 1994. In the historical record, it remains unmatched.

As someone living in the Desert Southwest, I can add my personal vouch that we’re not experiencing record heat even within my memory. But by ginning up all this climate hysteria, leftists hope to control people’s minds and actions. The woke activists who glue themselves to streets, splash paint over historic monuments, and swear not to have children because of “global warming” are brainwashed lackeys of Marxist elites. Their life goals are all defined by politicians instead of by their jobs, their families, and their friends.

Loving ‘Humanity,’ Hating Humans: Dostoevsky and Leftists’ False ‘Virtue’

And if people are afraid, as climate propaganda is meant to make them, they are a great deal easier to control and more likely to agree with the government assuming dictatorial powers. By the way, I don’t believe the propaganda is quite as effective as leftists would like, but fear is certainly their goal. As the insidious and climate fearmongering World Economic Forum (WEF) put it, you will “own nothing, have no privacy” and enjoy it — or else. Forget the facts that increased carbon is beneficial for plants and warming makes ecosystems thrive — Marxists have a dystopia to establish!

No major climate prediction has come true in over 50 years. The lies are more ridiculous today than they were half a century ago, but they are still dangerous. We might not be facing our ultimate doom from global warming, but we could be looking at a major dystopian push from Western, especially U.S., leadership that will fundamentally transform our lives."

 Why is ‘David Attenborough dead’ trending?

SIR DAVID Attenborough is a much-loved broadcaster and wildlife expert, who has fans all around the world.

In a recent death hoax, claims circulated that the beloved figure had passed away. However, it has since been revealed that this was only an internet rumour.

Why is ‘David Attenborough dead’ trending?

To fans' relief, the reason that ""David Attenborough dead"" is trending is that Sir David Attenborough is the victim of a death hoax.

There is no truth to it, and the wildlife expert is still alive.

The cruel hoax started when somebody wrote an ""Obituary of David Attenborough"" on WikiObits.

The fake obituary read: ""David Attenborough (born May 8th, 1926 in Isleworth, England) was an TV Personality who was best known for being a noted historian working for the BBC.

Read More on Attenborough

""David died on October 11th, 2023 (TBV) and his death was possibly because of natural causes. He was an impressive, 97 years old.""

However, the obituary is completely fake, and just a hoax to fool Sir David's loyal fans.

Has 'David Attenborough dead' trended before?

Sadly this isn't the first time that Sir David has been the victim of a death hoax.

In August 2023, ""David Attenborough dead"" was trending after rumours started spreading on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

Most read in Streaming

Fans again went online in a panic, but once again this was completely false news.

Famous faces are often the victims of death notices - only for them to be false.

One fan tweeted: ""Every time I see King David Attenborough on trending only to find out it's just him doing the absolute most for this planet to thrive as he usually does.""

Another agreed: ""Me seeing David Attenborough trending again and realising it’s just the usual legend work and not…the other thing.""

Who is David Attenborough?

Sir David Attenborough is a veteran broadcaster and wildlife expert, who was born on May 8, 1926, in Isleworth, London.

His brother is the late movie star Richard Attenborough, who was known for the original Jurassic Park trilogy.

Sir David started his career as the narrator of Wildlife On One in 1977 - the series then ran until 2005.

But he came to prominence with Life on Earth in 1979 which spawned a series of Life programmes including Life In The Freezer, The Private Life Of Plants, The Life Of Birds and The Life Of Mammals.

Sir David also narrated over 50 episodes of Natural World from 1992 until 2018.

He won high praise for The Blue Planet (2001), Planet Earth (2006) and Frozen Planet (2011).

Sir David is also known for the Planet Earth: Dynasties, and Climate Change - The Facts, and his work with Netflix.

Over the years he has built up an impressive net worth, and has an estimated wealth of £12million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Meanwhile, as of October 2023, Sir David is busy working on his next project, David Attenborough And The Giant Sea Monster."
EN_CC_200349.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Great Barrier Reef Doomsday Claims Should Be Audited: Scientist 

 Australian geo-physicist Peter Ridd says an additional $5 million (US$3.3 million) allocated to the Great Barrier Reef in this week’s budget would be better spent on “genuine environmental problems.”

The funding was handed down as part of Labor’s 2024 federal budget on May 14.

In a statement released last month, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation said the reef had suffered through the “worst summer” on record, with cyclones, severe flooding, starfish outbreaks and mass bleaching.

The funds will help the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to engage tourism operators undertaking reef monitoring, protection, and stewardship.

The Great Barrier Reef Foundation says the full extent of mass bleaching is not known, but claims aerial surveys over 1,000 reefs showed a rate of 73 percent bleaching within the area, plus another 6 percent in the Torres Strait.

Reef Subject to Constant ‘Doom-News’: RiddYet Mr. Ridd, a researcher into the Reef, believes its poor health has been greatly exaggerated.

“It is telling that in the latest doom-news about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, they failed to mention that the Great Barrier Reef had record amounts of coral in 2022/23 despite having suffered four ‘catastrophic’ bleaching events in 2016, 17, 20, and 22,” he told The Epoch Times in an email.

“We ended up with twice as much coral than in 2012 when a couple of cyclones genuinely destroyed a lot of coral.

“How did we end up with so much coral if those last four bleaching event were so catastrophic—even the fast-growing coral takes five to 10 years to regrow.”

The coral that bounced back, he says, is the type most susceptible to water bleaching.

“That proves the last four bleaching events were exaggerated in terms of the coral death, and there is no reason to expect this latest event to be much different,” he said.

Minister Says Jobs and Reef Depend on FundingFederal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek announced earlier this month that the government would also fund $17.48 million in local council projects to protect the Reef.

“We are committed to protecting our precious Great Barrier Reef and supporting the 64,000 jobs that depend on it,” she said in a statement.

“Protecting and restoring the Great Barrier Reef requires all levels of government and communities to work together.”

But Mr. Ridd says there’s evidence the Reef is thriving.

“The latest $5 million in the budget is just a drop in a bucket of how much cash is wasted ’saving' the Great Barrier Reef, which is actually one of the most pristine ecosystems on the planet,” he said.

“I estimate about $400 million are spent each year—and that is almost all wasted. We'd be better off spending it on genuine environmental problems.”

Mr. Ridd said the money could be used to audit the claims of widespread reef destruction.

“In the Great Barrier Reef science institutions there is a great deal of groupthink, emotion, and raw self-interest to maintain the fiction that the Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger,” he said.

“Dissenters are excluded and removed. The institutions need to be challenged by an official scientific ’red-team.’

“The cash could also be well spent on a publicity campaign pointing out the good condition on the reef. The recurring bad news and exaggeration is very bad for the Great Barrier Reef tourist industry.”

The March 2022–23 budget allocated a $1 billion funding package over nine years to help maintain the reef.

A spokesperson for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said a wide range of funding had been put in place to protect and maintain the World Heritage listed site.

“The Australian government has committed record funding of $1.2 billion in the Great Barrier Reef through to 2030, including an extra $5 million to extend the Tourism Reef Protection Initiative, so tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef can continue to play a key role in protecting this precious area,” a spokesperson told The Epoch Times."

 Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce

Under the Climate Action Plan 2023 (CAP 23) and subsequent CAP 24, Government has set an ambitious target of having an 80% share of electricity generation supplied by renewable sources by 2030 to create a more sustainable and resilient energy system for the future. To achieve the target, Government have committed to achieving 9 GW of onshore wind, 8 GW of solar PV and 500 MW of community energy over the same period.

The establishment of the Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce (""the ARE Taskforce"") was a key measure in CAP 23. The role of the ARE Taskforce is to identify, coordinate, and prioritise the policies required to fast-track and increase deployment of onshore renewable electricity generation and supporting technologies and ensure that barriers to the implementation of those policies are removed or minimised to the greatest extent possible, in order to meet these 2030 CAP targets.

The ARE Taskforce is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and its membership comprises senior officials from several government departments and state agencies.

Feeding into the Taskforce is a structure of nine Working Groups divided into the three pillars of renewables delivery:

The ARE Taskforce has prepared a programme of work, the ARE Taskforce Implementation Plan, setting out the initial objectives and milestones to deliver the onshore renewables and supporting infrastructure required to support the 80% renewable electricity target by 2030.

The Implementation Plan is a Taskforce-wide strategy and project plan, setting out the roadmap for the activities identified as being required to meet our 2030 onshore renewables targets (9 GW onshore wind and 8 GW Solar PV). The Implementation Plan will be updated periodically, taking into account future iterations of the Climate Action Plan and government policy."

 The declaration document, received by ANTARA in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Wednesday, stated that several G20 leaders agreed on a number of issues, including the importance of upholding international law and the multilateral system as well as handling the economic crisis through global macro-policies.

They also agreed to make efforts to ensure food and energy security and adopt digital technology to boost innovation.

G20 state leaders also called for a collective commitment to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), address climate change, and strengthen the health sector.

Lastly, G20 members expressed their appreciation of the Indonesian presidency for putting together a number of priority issues and coordinating international cooperation between member countries, invitee countries, as well as regional and international organizations.

At the G20 Summit’s opening session in Bali on Tuesday (November 15), President Joko Widodo had stressed that the discussions at the summit must not fail to lead to a conclusion that is beneficial for the global community.

The dialogues between countries, who represent 80 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), at the Bali G20 Leaders' Summit should be successful in producing concrete and useful outcomes for the world, he added.

He further said that the international community is paying close attention to the G20 Summit to determine whether it will end in success or failure.

The summit, which was held in the resort island of Bali and was attended by a majority of G20 heads of government, should be a success rather than a failure, he added.

 To the Editor:

It is refreshing to know that some school districts have voters with the common sense to apply their limited resources to issues that might matter for climate change, such as continuing to develop renewable sources of energy (wind, solar, geothermal, etc.) — or maybe just buy food for their family — rather than spend those funds on electric school buses. (”NY’s school bus dilemma: Some voters tap brakes on switch to electric vehicles,” July 29, 2024).

We 20 million New Yorkers should continue to oppose these types of programs and the rules and regulations (i.e., a gas stove ban!) that will cost each of us money but have negligible effect on climate change. Many of the 8 billion inhabitants of this planet will continue to use organic sources to cook, heat, drive and survive. They have little access to an electric infrastructure that will allow them to do otherwise.

Our own infrastructure may not support the change that some envision without costly upgrades. We definitely need to be a little cautious before paying for first-class accommodations on the climate change train, as noted in an Aug. 1 Wall Street Journal commentary by Bjorn Lomborg, “Polar Bears, Dead Coral and other Climate Fictions.” It notes that many of the dire predictions promoted by the climate lobby are simply not true.

Renewable energy resources are a good thing and, with time and with good policies, we will get there. Eliminating our oil and gas infrastructure in New York with costly rules and regulations may satisfy the climate change enthusiasts and their political cronies but will do nothing for climate change itself.

 A new report by the Climate and Health Alliance has suggested the Irish diet and food system is like a slow-motion disaster, fuelling premature death and disability due to diet-related chronic diseases.

The report calls for the ending of the junk food cycle and a switch away from processed foods to more plant-based diets.

The report said the global food system can feed the world, but it has also made people heavier and sicker.

The report also said it destroys wildlife, pollutes rivers and air, and is responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions.

The report is concerned that ultra-processed foods and excessive red and processed meat are dominating the Irish diet at the expense of fruit, vegetables, plant proteins, whole grains, and sustainable seafood.

The Alliance has called for a special Cabinet sub-committee to oversee ""a food revolution"" and for the farming industry to be a key part of the solution.

A dietitian with the Irish Heart Foundation said the ""playbook for smoking"" needs to be applied to junk food.

Speaking to RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Orna O'Brien explained this would restrict the marketing and promotion of junk foods.

She called for policy and structural changes to be implemented to encourage consumers to buy less processed food.

Junk foods should be made more expensive and inaccessible, she said.

Ms O'Brien stressed that such a move is not about punishing individuals for buying processed food but a mandatory reformation of processed food to make them lower in salt, sugar and fat.

However, she added, overall, a move back to a less processed food system is needed."

 Ros Druce knows there’s toxic coal dust in the air she breathes.

In 2016, NSW’s environmental watchdog tested some of the black residue that had sullied her barbecue area.

“They said it was 15 per cent coal dust back then. But that was before they were blasting four days a week and everything else,” she says from her family’s property, 7km from Whitehaven Coal’s Maules Creek Mine.

“I can’t have a vegetable garden any more because there’s so much fallout from when they blast that it covers all the vegetables, the grass, everything.”

Indoors, it’s more of the same, with coal dust “everywhere” and constant worry about what years of exposure might be doing to her health.

But hope is on the horizon – a Land and Environment Court challenge due to begin on Tuesday.

Ms Druce and other members of the Maules Creek Community Council are contesting the Environment Protection Authority’s 2023 review of the mine’s environmental protection licence.

They will argue the watchdog failed to protect environmental and human health, and did not consider “relevant” pollutants, namely fine-particle pollution and methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas.

Specifically the case will deal with PM2.5 – pollution particles so small they can get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream.

Prolonged exposure can cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease and shorten lives.

The Environmental Defenders Office is representing the community group and will argue the watchdog did not satisfy a legal requirement to consider relevant pollutants and measures that could reduce that pollution when it renewed the mine’s licence in 2023.

If the community group wins, the EPA would have to carry out a fresh review that considers the impact of all the harmful pollutants, and what could be done to reduce impacts.

Ms Druce says she’s hoping for a “landmark win” that will help anyone who might be in her position."

The devastating landslides which struck Kerala's Wayanad were triggered by incessant rainfall which was 10 per cent more intense due to climate change, according to a new study by the scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.

The region recorded more than 140 mm of rain in a single day on highly soaked soils due to monsoon rainfall for two months. This triggered devastating landslides and floods claiming at least 231 lives in Wayanad, the researchers said.

Also read | Wayanad landslides: PM Modi conducts aerial survey of disaster-hit areas, meets victims' families

""The rainfall that triggered the landslides occurred in a region of Wayanad that has the highest landslide risk in the state. Even heavier downpours are expected as the climate warms, which underscores the urgency to prepare for similar landslides in northern Kerala,"" said Maja Vahlberg, a climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.

The team of 24 scientists from India, the US, the UK, and Sweden examined climate models with high resolutions to reflect the rainfall activity in the Wayanad region for calculating the influence of humans on climate change.

The models suggest that climate change caused a 10 per cent increase in the intensity of the rainfall, they said. The models also forecast a further four per cent increase in the intensity of rainfall if there is a rise in the world's average temperature by two degrees Celsius.

However, a ""high level of uncertainty"" revolves around the research model as the region of study is small and mountainous with complicated dynamics of rainfall and climate.

According to scientists, events of this severity are likely to become more common in India and the rest of the world as the climate becomes warmer and warmer. In warmer temperatures air carries more moisture which leads to such heavy downpours in a single day.

Wayanad landslide was the third most intense in the state of Kerala since the Indian weather department started keeping records in 1901."

 Consumers and businesses urged to use a brown bin

Consumers and businesses are being urged to use a brown bin, recycle their food waste and reduce their carbon footprint, following National Food Waste Recycling Week, which ran from June 2-9.

New research of over 1,000 adults found that over two thirds of all householders in Ireland currently use a brown bin and, of those who do, helping climate change is their top motivation.

However, a recent study from the Environmental Protection Agency found that, in commercial general waste bins, 30% of the contents are food waste; while in household general waste bins, 17% of the content is food waste, meaning this food waste will never be recycled.

“We’ve made great progress in Ireland with over two thirds of people now using a brown bin but, as we see from the research, there is still a high proportion of food waste that could be recycled going into our general waste bins,” said Pauline McDonogh, Resource Efficiency Officer at MyWaste.ie

“The introduction of new legislation means everyone, everywhere in Ireland with a kerbside waste collection service is now entitled to a brown bin service. We’d urge everyone – consumers and businesses – if you don’t use a brown bin, please start, and make a positive change for our environment,” she added.

In Ireland it’s estimated we waste about 750,000 tonnes of food each year. Food waste that ends up in landfill is a significant contributor to climate change – food waste is estimated to generate up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing food waste has both environmental and financial benefits.

The brown bin service accepts all types of food: Raw and cooked meat and fish, plate scrapings, and fruit and vegetable peelings, in addition to food-soiled paper napkins, paper towels, greasy pizza boxes, and light garden waste.

 DENVER — Denver Public Schools is trying to create the next generation of renewable energy leaders with a special summer program.

“I think the youth are going to be bringing that forward more. They're really sensitive to climate action and also climate anxiety, and so this is a proactive way to really impact their world and the future, as far as making sure that we have a sustainable planet,” Monica Schultz, senior manager for DPS’s Career Navigation Services, said.

Nearly 40 high schoolers are taking part in the Renewable Energy Academy this year — a joint effort between DPS and nonprofit solar company GRID Alternatives Colorado.

""We've went to... workshops at GRID Alternatives... There's harnesses, things that keep you on the roof so you don't... fall off. We were pretty much learning about the safeties of... installing solar panels. And then we would also learn how to install a panel onto a roof,"" Surafel Alemayehu, one of the high schoolers taking part in the program, explained to Denver7.

The students also learned about circuitry.

""We're trying to learn more about, like how the electricity flows into the battery from the DC, the AC, the inverter and so on,"" Alemayehu said.

In addition to visiting GRID Alernatives, participants will take field trips to different renewable energy companies and solar farms across the Denver metro area.

""They get to see the industry in action through partnerships with various businesses in Denver,” Schultz said.

The whole program lasts four weeks.

Once the Renewable Energy Academy wraps up, students like Alemayehu will have the basic skills needed for an entry-level job in the industry.

""I think there's a personal aspect of it in terms of reminding their family to turn off the light when they leave a room. But then there's also the aspect of understanding the career opportunities,"" Schultz said.

This is part of a three-year grant that the City of Denver awarded DPS in 2022 for career preparation and exploration focused on green construction and sustainability."

 Spain: Thousands evacuated over La Palma wildfireJuly 16, 2023

Favorable weather conditions have allowed firefighters on the Spanish island of La Palma to slow the advance of wildfires that forced thousands of people to evacuate Saturday.

More than 4,000 people were told to evacuate, authorities said, and at least 20 houses were destroyed.

""There has been some resistance by local people to leaving their homes, but I appeal to people to be responsible,"" Fernando Clavijo, the regional president of the Canary Islands, told reporters.

Clavijo also said the fire ""advanced very quickly"" due to ""the wind, the climate conditions as well as the heat wave that we are living through."" Like the Spanish mainland, La Palma has also seen far less rain than usual over the past several years as a result of climate change.

So far, about 4,600 hectares or 11,300 acres of land have been destroyed by the fire, authorities said.

Firefighters battle to put out blaze

Spain's army has deployed some 300 of its firefighters to help local crews battle the blaze. The military has dispatched nine water-carrying helicopters and two airplanes to the scene.

On Sunday, 86 members of Spain's Military Emergency Unity also arrived on the island.

The fire is on the western side of the island on wooded, hilly terrain dotted with homes.

La Palma, with a population of 85,000, is one of eight members of Spain’s Canary Islands archipelago off Africa’s western coast. In 2021, it was hit by a volcanic eruption that lasted around three months, forcing thousands to evacuate and causing around €900 million ($1.01 billion) of damage.

Patricia Sanchez of the Spanish Red Cross told AFP news agency she felt ""powerless"" in knowing that ""there are people who lost everything because of the volcano and have rebuilt their lives in the north, and now they are evacuated again... and risk losing everything again.""

The wildfire on La Palma coincides with blistering heat that has swept southern European countries, as scientists warn climate change could significantly increase wildfires across the globe."

 BERLIN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Climate activists from the Last Generation environmental group staged nationwide protests in Germany on Friday against the government's transport policy by disrupting traffic in 26 cities.

The members of the group are known in Germany as Klimakleber (climate stickers) as they are frequently gluing themselves to roads and infrastructure to block traffic and gain attention. In the capital Berlin, for example, the main traffic circle around the Victory Column was blocked in this way.

The activists accuse the government of ""breaking its own climate law,"" arguing that the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) refused to present an emergency climate protection program as required by German law.

While Germany met its overall emission reduction target in 2022, the transport sector slightly increased its emissions compared to the previous year, according to the Federal Environment Agency (UBA).

Internationally, transport is also failing to deliver on climate change mitigation, as global decarbonization measures would currently only lead to a 3 percent reduction in emissions in the sector by 2050, according to the International Transport Forum (ITF).

The transport sector would ""miss by a wide margin the reduction needed to keep climate change in check,"" the ITF warned in May.

To meet the Paris Agreement's net-zero target by 2050, transport-related CO2 emissions would need to fall by at least 3 percent annually until 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned.

The activists' measures are not supported by a majority of Germany's population, sometimes even provoking violent reactions. Earlier this week, a truck driver drove into an activist. Although no one was injured, the driver could now lose his license.

On Thursday, the group already blocked two major airports in the middle of the summer vacation season, preventing flights from taking off or landing for hours. With this, the activists were ""doing massive damage to the cause of climate protection,"" Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck said.

 Lawsuit filed in bid to halt Alaska oil drilling project

Washington (AFP) – Environmental groups filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to halt a controversial oil drilling project in Alaska approved by the Biden administration.


The Interior Department gave the green light on Monday to US energy giant ConocoPhillips to drill for oil at three sites in the federally owned National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska's pristine western Arctic.

Environmental groups had urged President Joe Biden, who vowed during the 2020 White House race not to approve any new oil and gas leases on public lands, to reject the so-called Willow Project.

The six groups that filed the suit in US District Court accused the Interior Department and other agencies of violating the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and other laws by authorizing the project.

""ConocoPhillips' massive oil and gas project presents a real threat to the wildlife, ecosystems, and communities of Arctic Alaska,"" said Mike Scott of the Sierra Club, one of the complainants in the suit.

""If they're allowed to break ground, the Willow Project would be a disaster for the climate, the effects of which would be felt for decades,"" Scott said in a statement.

Reacting to the Biden administration's approval of the project on Monday, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan said that legal efforts to stop the project had been expected.

""We are prepared to defend this decision against likely frivolous legal challenges from the same Lower 48 NGOs who've consistently tried to kill the Willow Project,"" Sullivan said.

Alaska lawmakers lobbied strongly for approval of the drilling plan, defending it as a source of several thousand jobs and a contributor to US energy independence, with production of 180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, or some 576 million barrels over 30 years.

The Willow Project will add 239 million metric tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere over the next 30 years, according to Interior Department calculations, equivalent to the annual emissions of 64 coal-fired power plants.

Biden has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005, with the goal of achieving a net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050."

 The planning application process needs “urgent” reform in order to accelerate wind and solar projects to meet national renewable energy targets, a new report has warned.

The report from the Climate Change Advisory Council said the target to increase renewable energy capacity by 1.6GW will not be met without changes to the planning system.

It highlighted that an onshore wind farm was not granted planning permission in the 12 months to September 2023.

This project, which was the only one to receive planning permission from a local authority, is now subject to an appeal.

There were four wind farms granted approval from An Bord Pleanála in late 2023, with all of them currently undergoing judicial review.

Five others were granted permission on conclusion of an appeals process following an original local authority decision.

“These appeals will add significant delays to the development of these projects, making 2030 targets increasingly difficult to achieve.

“Of those applications that received a decision, projects accounting for approximately 20% of wind capacity and 15% of solar capacity were refused,” the report stated.

Offshore

It was also recommended in the report that the Government immediately adopt the plan for the rollout of offshore wind power off the south coast.

This, it said, would avoid further delays in offshore wind generation.

“The council is calling on the Government to finalise and adopt the South Coast Designated Maritime Area Plan by summer 2024.

“Any delay in its publication risks not achieving Ireland’s 2030 offshore wind targets,” the report said.

The report also said Ireland is behind at European level when it comes to offshore wind generation.

Recommendations

Further recommendations from the report include stopping the use of coal and oil to generate electricity, pricing incentives for data centres to shift electricity usage to times of low carbon emissions and publishing a long-term strategy for the delivery of a zero-carbon electricity system.

Ensuring future infrastructure is resilient to projected climate impacts, such as floods, was also recommended.

Solar

There was a 90% increase in applications for solar microgeneration installations last year compared with 2022.

ESB Networks received 33,000 applications for microgeneration installations of up to 6 or11 kVA in 2023, typically domestic rooftop solar PV installations.

 Nigeria, others urged to increase funding for research on climate change

The Nigerian government and other African governments have been urged to increase funding and support for research on emerging climate change issues.

The call was made at the recently concluded African Health Agenda International Conference (AHAIC) 2023. Delegates at the event and their governments were reminded that research on issues such as climate-health nexus, carbon removal and green cities across Africa can no longer be pushed to the periphery.

Deputy Director General of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), Faustin Munyazikwiye, said climate research funding needs the political goodwill of African countries so that they align the research to the specific challenges they want to tackle.

“We can think globally but act locally and find home-grown solutions. We need to establish our funds from our domestic sources before we seek international help,” he said.

Head of Capacity and Field Development at Wellcome Trust, Modi Mwatsama, said African governments need to do a lot of mobilisation for investment in research that is evidence-based and relevant.

“We must encourage our governments to have climate strategies and increase their budgets for research. They also need to work with other stakeholders to make sure the research can help the people they are meant for,” said Ms Mwatsama.

According to a study published in the journal, Climate and Development, more than 75 per cent of funds earmarked for climate research in Africa go to institutes in the US and Europe.

The study says there is already a deep funding deficit in Africa, with less than five per cent of the funds allocated to climate research globally focusing on Africa.

“Of the $620 million that financed Africa-related climate research between 1990 and 2020, research institutions based in Europe and the United States received $480 million while the ones in Africa got only $89.15 million,” says the study.

Ms Mwatsama said this skewed financing of Africa-related research can only be solved by Africans themselves developing a more active approach to research funding and building a strong financial base for research, adding that, “even as we mainstream the health agenda in the climate arena, we need to build a constituency that can articulate cross-cutting issues such as indoor health, clean water, agriculture and nutrition.”"

 New Jersey Natural Gas Announces Installation of State’s First CarbinX Carbon Capture Units

Building on its commitment to develop and deploy innovative approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, New Jersey Natural Gas (NJNG), the principal subsidiary of New Jersey Resources (NYSE: NJR), announced it has installed and is now operating two CarbinX carbon-capture systems at its Wall, N.J. headquarters. These units are the first of their kind in operation in New Jersey.

Each CarbinX unit is about the size of two residential refrigerators and connects to NJNG’s HVAC system, where it captures carbon emissions from the building that otherwise would be emitted as flue exhaust. The units also improve the overall efficiency of the facility’s water heater by converting waste heat to heated water – thus, decreasing water heater usage, reducing emissions and lowering energy costs.

“Innovation is critical to achieving our climate and emissions reduction goals in a way that is affordable, reliable and achievable,” said Patrick Migliaccio, senior vice president and chief operating officer at New Jersey Natural Gas. “The carbon capture units installed at our Wall headquarters are part of NJNG’s broader decarbonization strategy to reduce emissions from our operations and support New Jersey’s climate objectives in a way that is easy to adopt.”

Developed by Canada-based CleanO2, CarbinX is a breakthrough technology that converts carbon emissions into a nontoxic solid called pearl ash. Pearl ash can be repurposed for different applications, including commercial products such as soaps and detergents and durable building materials.

Additionally, NJNG is engaging with a third party to perform monitoring, data collection and an in-depth evaluation to fully understand the systems’ real-world benefits. This information will enable NJNG to inform customers and state policymakers about the potential of this technology to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.

“Distributed carbon capture is about more than just reducing emissions; it is also about maximizing the efficiency of the energy we use,” Migliaccio added. “As a flue gas economizer, these carbon-capture units can help businesses use less energy and take advantage of benefits offered under the state’s energy-efficiency programs. The installation of units like these is another way for businesses to help lower their carbon footprint. We look forward to learning from this project and identifying future opportunities.”"

Savor, backed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, said that its experiments with creating diary-free alternatives to ice-cream, cheese, and milk have produced a new animal-free butter alternative. This has been made by utilising a thermochemical process that allows it to build fat molecules, creating chains of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and oxygen.

Savor said that its products will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than animal-based ones as the “butter” comes in at less than 0.8g CO2 equivalent per kg. In contrast, real unsalted butter with 80% fat has a standard climate footprint of 16.9kg CO2 equivalent per kg.

Kathleen Alexander, Savor’s chief executive, said, “We are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025. So far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people.

On Friday, Newsom’s office posted on X “Big Oil has been lying to us – covering up the fact that they’ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet. It has been decades of damage & deception. With @AGRobBonta , California is taking action to hold big polluters accountable.”

The “big polluters” referred to in the post include Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and ConocoPhillips, Reuters reported. The American Petroleum Institute is also among the defendants.

The lawsuit alleges these companies had caused Californians billions of dollars in damages and its authors plan to create what they call an abatement fund to use for coverage of future damages, the Reuters report also noted.

On Sunday, Newsom called the damage already done “incalculable”.

The state of California has been at the forefront of the energy transition, sporting the highest fuel prices in the nation and also the biggest EV market. California is also a major electricity importer from other states and an oil importer, too.

Earlier this year, Governor Newsom signed a bill for the ban of internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035 in California, following in the footsteps of the European Union and the UK, both with their own ICE car bans in the works.

In comments on the lawsuit, Chevron said “Climate change is a global problem that requires a coordinated international policy response, not piecemeal litigation for the benefit of lawyers and politicians.”

“Its local courts have no constructive or constitutionally permissible role in crafting global energy policy,” a company spokesman also said, as quoted by Bloomberg."

 The effects of climate change are increasingly evident in various parts of the planet. In Costa Rica, the impact is apparent due to high temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and now the decline in sea turtle hatchlings.

Experts from the APM Terminals Turtle Conservation Program, which protects sea turtle eggs and releases hatchlings on the beach that spans from the mouth of the Moín river to the mouth of the Matina River, have determined that this year the number of hatchlings and turtle releases in Moín will reach 10,000. In contrast, in 2022, approximately 30,000 turtles were released.

Climate change and its repercussions, such as rising sea levels, high sea temperatures, and shifts in migration and feeding patterns, are resulting in fewer hatchlings.

“There’s a decrease in turtle births on all nesting beaches from the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia to southern Nicaragua. We are monitoring data related to conditions exacerbated by and associated with climate change, such as warm waters in the North Atlantic that produce less food, and hot beaches with temperatures exceeding 34° Celsius, leading to infertile nests,” said Didiher Chacón, a specialist in Marine Sciences and the director of the Latin American Sea Turtles Association.

Risk factors

Climate change presents challenges that threaten the development of fertile turtle eggs and the births of leatherback, green, and hawksbill turtles.

For instance, sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination. During incubation, the temperature determines whether the offspring will be male or female. Rising temperatures are producing more female turtles, thereby reducing the chances of reproduction.

Furthermore, the rise in sea levels, due to glacier melting and the thermal expansion of the oceans, results in a loss of nesting and feeding habitats for sea turtles. Nesting beaches may erode or become submerged, limiting the available space for turtles to nest.

Marine species rely on ocean currents and water temperatures for their migrations. Climate change can disrupt these patterns, affecting the availability of food and altering the migration routes of sea turtles.

Moreover, climate change can influence the availability and distribution of the turtles’ prey. Fluctuations in water temperatures and ocean acidification can destabilize marine ecosystems, thereby impacting the quantity and quality of food sources for sea turtles.

Didiher Chacón emphasized that people can help the cause through actions such as abstaining from consuming turtle eggs, participating in volunteer programs aimed at nest protection, cleaning beaches, minimizing their greenhouse gas emissions, recycling to curtail the demand for plastics, and educating the younger generations about these measures."

 July 15, 2023

More than a third of Americans are under heat advisories as extreme temperatures are likely to hit several states in the United States this weekend, BBC reported.

About 113 million people in the US have been affected by the advisories from Florida to Texas to California up to the north-western state of Washington.

The extreme temperatures have forced the residents to use air conditioners while people have broken the record for power consumption in Texas since last year.

As many as 27 million people are expected to suffer from high temperatures of over 43°C in the coming days.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the heat is caused by an upper-level ridge of high pressure, calling it ""one of the strongest"" systems to be experienced by the region.

""The subtropical ridge responsible for this likely historic heatwave across the region is not showing signs of letting up anytime soon,"" the NWS said.

The estimated number of people to die from heat-related incidents in the US is 700, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

The daytime temperatures are expected to remain up to 46°C (today) while the heat is forecast to remain until next week.

The temperatures in Phoenix are likely to hit or exceed 43°C in the next five days, breaking its longest hot spell which lasted 18 days.

Las Vegas may experience 47°C in the next few days while Death Valley, California is also expected to surpass its all-time high temperature of 54°C.

A warning was issued to the Las Vegas residents by the NWS. ""'It's the desert, of course its hot'- This is a DANGEROUS mind set! This heatwave is NOT typical desert heat due to its long duration, extreme daytime temperatures, & warm nights. Everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert,"" it said.

The extreme heat has also forced the closure or shortening of hours of parks, museums, zoos and businesses.

Moreover, hospitals are also seeing cases related to heat.

""We're getting a lot of heat-related illness now, a lot of dehydration, heat exhaustion,"" said Dr Ashkan Morim, who works at Dignity Health Siena Hospital, outside of Las Vegas.

Meanwhile, the heatwave has also grappled Europe which led to the closure of a major tourist attraction in Greece on Friday.

The high temperatures are a result of climate change and El Niño, say the scientists."

 A bill set to go before the Senate during the current period gives corporations the green light to continue greenwashing their financial statements for the next three years, environmental advocates say.

The government's current bill to force corporations to disclose their climate risk includes a clause that gives businesses legal immunity from private claims brought against false or misleading climate statements for three years from January 2025.

During his first reading of the bill, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the three-year transition period acknowledged that making climate disclosures for the first time would be ""challenging"" for some businesses.

""ASIC can still take action for breaches of the reporting requirements during this period,"" he said.

However, many businesses already report their climate risks, particularly large public corporations and major emitters, after sustained shareholder pressure.

Director of corporate climate NGO Climate Integrity Claire Snyder said the immunity period opened the door to misleading statements from corporations about their emissions reductions plans.

""Three years of legal immunity would give a greenlight to continue greenwashing in company reporting and delay urgently needed climate action,"" Ms Snyder said.

Australia's corporate regulators have recently been taking action on greenwashing by major corporations, after a 2023 survey by the ACCC found half of businesses had made misleading statements about their environmental credentials.

Earlier this month, financial superannuation Mercer paid $11.3 million in the first greenwashing case brought by corporate enforcer ASIC.

However despite this and other actions against Vanguard Investments and Active Super, there are concerns that ASIC does not have the resources to pursue corporate greenwashing cases, given the widespread nature of the issue.

Greens senator Nick McKim said the immunity period was too long.

""ASIC being the gatekeeper does not fill us with confidence as they hardly have a reputation as a tough cop on the beat,"" he said.

A recent Senate inquiry found ASIC had ""comprehensively failed"" to fulfil its regulatory remit and was ""reluctant or unwilling"" to commence investigations into misconduct.

The Greens have proposed an amendment to the bill to reduce the legal immunity period to one year.

ACT senator David Pocock, in additional comments to a Senate review of the bill, said there was no time to waste in holding large emitters to account.

""Given the decades of lost opportunity to address the impacts of climate change in this country, we simply don't have the luxury of time any more to dispense liability holidays to large fossil fuel producers and emitters, especially absent any good articulated reason to do so.""

Treasurer Jim Chalmers was contacted for comment.

 FOOTAGE shows the moment two eco-idiots glued themselves to a dinosaur display at a German museum in front of a group of bemused visitors.

The latest daft stunt, undertaken by the 'Letzte Generation' (Last Generation) climate activist group, took place at Berlin’s National Museum this afternoon.

A video clip showed how the two women - wearing hi-vi vests - had entered the site before supergluing themselves to the giant dinosaur model.

Museumgoers were stunned as the duo pedalled rhetoric that accused the German government of failing to properly address the threat of climate change.

The stunt, which was later shared on social media, appeared to be a copycat of antics at several other sites where protesters have glued themselves to priceless pieces.

In this case it is unknown whether the model, which is held up by supportive poles, was damaged.

The latest stunt comes just days after the campaign group tarnished a £100million Clade Monet masterpiece with mashed potato.

At the time, the group admitted to being inspired by antics at the National Gallery in London earlier this month which drew global attention.

The Just Stop Oil activists - named as Anna Holland, 20, and 21-year-old Phoebe Plummer - chucked tomato soup over Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers painting.

They were arrested for criminal damage and aggravated trespass but both eco-zealots pleaded not guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court.


Their trial date is set for December 13 at the City of London Magistrates' Court.

Meanwhile, it has since been revealed that Just Stop Oil has been paying its protesters to clog Britain's roads as the country continues to be plagued by demonstrations.

The organisation, which has repeatedly brought traffic grinding to a halt over the last few weeks, is bankrolled by the mega-rich.

This month alone, Just Stop Oil has blocked roads across England, sparking fury among motorists.

In Knightsbridge, London, the green warriors stopped a sick baby getting to hospital and a fire engine responding to blaze.

Days later, furious members of the public dragged the mob from the tarmac for preventing a van driver from visiting his ill wife.

But most notably, the protesters caused mayhem on the M25 by scaling the 275ft QEII Bridge.

Queues reached at least six miles long while the idiots dangled from the structure - with two even chilling in a hammock.

The duo - later named as Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker - were accused of having ""blood on their hands"" after two women died during their eco action."

 Monrovia, Liberia — the Africa Youth Partnership — Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT) in partnership with ActionAid Liberia hosted a Climate Justice Community Engagement and Awareness Campaign at the People United Community Palava Hut on 20th Street, Beachside, Monrovia, Liberia.

The Campaign, which is an activity under the Strategic Partnership Agreement, brought together leaders and residents of the People United Community, LYTT members, the media, etc., gears toward raising awareness about Climate Change and Environmental injustices and to sensitize community residents about sustainable climate practices.

After the opening formalities, the Campaign begin with an Introduction to the Campaign by the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT) Climate Justice & Environmental Project Lead, Madam Yundeh Afreda Butler, a staunch climate advocate and environmentalist.

During her deliberation, she called for a transition to renewable energy and agroecoly, also addressing climate change driven conflict, and its’ effect on women and girls.

She encouraged the audience to engage into sustainable climate actions that will enhance environmental sustainability.

“She informed the audience that the campaign seeks to rally support from more than five million people worldwide including policy makers, youth, and government authorities to fix the issue of Climate Finance that will enhance mitigation and adaption actions that will in turn address climate change.” Madam Butler.

In addition to that, Mr. Amara B. Kanneh, a Development Expert and Director of Programs of the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT), informed the audience about the LYTT Social Media Campaign on Climate Justice that was launched four days ago and encouraged the audience to join the Social Media Campaign and amplify youth voices to effect policy actions and decisions for a just climate transition.

On the part of the Community, Youth Chairlady, Mrs. Rebecca Slocum, lamented on the challenges that the People United Community is faced with; such as: lack of adequate Waste Holding Station, Lack of proper Drainage System at the JFK Hospital which result in over flooding of the People United Community whenever rainfall, Sanding Mining from the Beach, etc.

She furthered appreciated the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT) and the Actionaid Liberia (AAL) for partnering to host such an eye-opening and educative program that reminded the resident of People United Community about their role in the fight against Climate Change.

The Campaign concluded with a remark by Jacob B. Swee, Jr., a Professional Accountant in public practice and Team Lead of the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT); during his deliberation he reminded the residents of People United Community that a little sustainable climate action on a daily basis can make a huge difference in the global fight against Climate change.

 Warmer winters bringing earlier blooms and earlier bugs, experts say

BALTIMORE -- If you enjoyed the extra sunshine and hotter temperatures this winter season, then enjoy the sweet fragrance of cherry blossoms blooming early.

But brace yourself for the early arrival of bugs.

Washington D.C's famous cherry blossoms tend to be the go-to indicator that Spring is here.

Mike Litterst with the National Park Service and National Mall said after experiencing the third warmest winter on record in the DC area, the cherry blossoms could bloom as early as March 22nd to March 25th.

""But it was so warm this year,"" Litterst said. ""It's complicating things a little bit.""

Normally, the blossoms are inactive during the winter. But the warmer temperatures this season are kicking off the blooming period earlier.

""We're seeing, if you will, some confusion in the trees about this,"" he said. ""Our primary indicator tree is showing four different stages of the bloom process depending on which branches you're looking at.""

But blossoms are not the only visitors that may pay us a visit sooner rather than later.

""This could turn out to be a very buggy year,"" University of Maryland Professor Emeritus of Entomology Michael Raupp said.

Michael Raupp, otherwise known as ""The Bug Guy,"" said with blossoms expected to open two weeks sooner, we can expect to see more pollinators.

""The honeybees are busy,"" Raupp said. ""The carpenter bees are out looking for pollen sources right now.""

Though you may be tempted to show a little more skin because of the warmer weather, mosquitoes will be out in full force. So, have some extra bug spray on hand.

""At the temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, it will take mosquitoes about two to three weeks to develop but at 90 degrees Fahrenheit they're going to do it in one week,"" Raupp said. ""That means we will have twice as many generations in the same amount of time.""

A spike in ticks is also a concern as it could lead to lime disease and red meat allergies.

Raupp said if you spot a tick on your body after a hike remove it in the first 24 hours. Then, wash your clothes and dry them for half an hour to kill any remaining ticks.

""The bugs that have been just hanging out there just waiting for a little warmth, hey guess what, they got it in spades right now,"" he said.

Maryland's growers are also facing some challenges because of the early heat.

""We're already hearing reports from our growers around the state that the Alfalfa Weevil, which is an important pest on certain crops and usually doesn't appear for several weeks, is actually active now and beginning to create damage on our forage crops,"" he said.

However, Raupp and Litterst say because of climate change all these changes are not surprising and may just become our new norm."

 The science of climate change often is presented in complicated language that speaks of computer models and the theoretical inputs and outputs thereof and concludes that the globe is on the verge of “boiling.” Well, leave it to three physicists -- steeped in calculus and such arcane matters as the behavior of molecules and the nuclear charge of atoms -- to simplify the analysis and arrive at a much less alarming determination.

“Straightforward calculations … show that eliminating U.S. CO2 emissions by the year 2050 would avoid a temperature increase of 0.0084 degrees Celsius,” states a brief paper authored by Drs. Richard Lindzen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; William Happer, Princeton University; and William A. van Wijngaarden, York University, Toronto. On the Fahrenheit scale, the value of averted warming is 0.015 ◦F degrees.

In short, the amount of warming averted by eliminating CO2 emissions in the United States would be too small to measure. The paper bolsters the position of those who argue that a changing climate is the product of natural forces, that human-induced carbon dioxide emissions can have only a minuscule effect on global temperature, and that CO2 is a valuable plant food and not a pollutant.

Rather than using theoretical assumptions about various factors that are fed into computers, the paper’s calculation relies almost exclusively on “observable data” that are widely accepted and publicly available, says Dr. Happer.

“This is something anybody with a calculator can figure out,” said the scientist, who may be best known for his contribution to a laser-based technology for destroying incoming ballistic missiles as part of the so-called Star Wars program of the 1980s.

The data needed for the math are the number of years until 2050, the amount of carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere, which scientists regularly measure, and the current concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is approximately 427 parts per million as of June 2024.

The only assumed datapoint is the sensitivity of the atmosphere to CO2 increases. The paper uses a value almost the same as one commonly used “before global-warming alarmism became fashionable.” Even if the value is quadrupled to a number favored by the politically driven Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amount of warming averted still is only 0.034 degrees Celsius.

So, what if the entire world eliminated carbon dioxide emissions from the activities of mankind? Since U.S. emissions account for 12% of global output, the answer lies in the math to determine the remaining 88%. The paper’s calculation is that the amount of warming averted would be 0.07 degrees Celsius. Using the higher IPCC sensitivity value, the number quadruples to 0.28 degrees Celsius. Both are still inconsequential and certainly not worth destroying the world economy.

Noting that others using different approaches have come to conclusions similar to the paper’s, Dr. Happer said he and his coauthors wanted to show that the controversial subject of climate change need not be complicated.

“More members of the public should understand that they are being victimized by false information disseminated by those whose interests have more to do with money and power than with environmental concerns,” he said. “Answers found in relatively simple mathematics strongly suggest this to be the case.”

Whatever the motivations, spending trillions of dollars to replace fossil fuels with expensive and unreliable wind and solar sources is foolish, futile and dangerous."

 Climate activists dump pink powder on case containing US Constitution

Two climate change activists appeared in court on Thursday for throwing pink powder on glass cases displaying the U.S. Constitution at the National Archives Museum in Washington, according to the U.S. attorney's office and court records.

Two climate change activists appeared in court on Thursday for throwing pink powder on glass cases displaying the U.S. Constitution at the National Archives Museum in Washington, according to the U.S. attorney's office and court records. The revered founding document, written on four sheets of parchment in 1787, was protected by its display encasement and not damaged, the National Archives said.

Police arrested Donald Zepeda and Jackson Green on Wednesday afternoon for what the National Archives called an act of vandalism after they dispersed balloons filled with magenta pink tempera paint powder across the display, according to a court filing by a special agent in the archive's inspector general's office. The museum's rotunda was closed for cleaning on Thursday, costing the government $15,780.62, according to the filing in the D.C. Superior Court. It will remain closed on Friday.

Videos posted on social media showed the two men stood by the powder-dusted cases in the museum's grand rotunda with their hands and clothes covered in the pink powder. Paraphrasing the Constitution, they told onlookers they believed everyone on the planet had a right to clean air and a livable climate, and called on U.S. President Joe Biden to declare a climate emergency, shortly before they were detained by museum security staff.

They were arrested on charges of defacing and destruction of public property under Washington local law, according to the court filing, a crime with a maximum sentence of up to 180 days in prison. It was not clear if they would also face more serious federal charges of destruction of government property. One of the two men told investigators they were part of the Declare Emergency campaign, which says it uses civil resistance techniques to try and force the U.S. government to take emergency action on climate change.

The campaign did not immediately respond to questions on Thursday, but shared videos of the episode on social media, writing: ""We the people will not stand for corporate greed and climate destruction."" In recent years, climate activists around the world have targeted revered paintings and other cultural artifacts to draw attention to their cause.

In 2022, an activist threw cake at Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris. A few months later, two activists splashed the glass case protecting Vincent van Gogh's Fifteen Sunflowers with tomato soup at London's National Gallery, causing minor damage to the frame. Other activists have glued themselves to famous artworks. The National Archives said the rotunda and the display of the Constitution would reopen soon.

""We take such vandalism very seriously and we will insist that the perpetrators be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Archivist of the United States Colleen Shogan said in a statement. Neither of the men could immediately be reached for comment and it was not clear if they were represented by lawyers. They are due back in court on March 20th, and meanwhile have been ordered not to return to the National Archives."

 Tory MP urges Keir Starmer to confirm if his plans for a new wave of wind farms are unconnected to the million pound Labour party donations made by eco-tycoon Dale Vince

- Ecotricity founder has said new wind parks 'make good economic sense'

Sir Keir Starmer should make clear that his plans for a new wave of wind farms are unconnected to the millions of pounds donated to Labour by an eco-tycoon, a Tory MP said last night.

One of Starmer's first acts after becoming Prime Minister was to lift the effective ban on onshore wind generation – in place since 2015 – giving the green light to a new wave of wind farms across the country.

The move comes in the wake of donations totalling £4.2 million from Ecotricity, a green energy supplier founded by millionaire Dale Vince – £2.7 million was accepted by the Labour Party in the first four months of 2024 alone.

Both Labour and Ecotricity strongly deny any connection between the donations and the policy change, but Ruislip MP David Simmonds said last night that it 'raised some serious questions'.

He said: 'In the spirit of transparency, we can only hope Keir Starmer answers these questions swiftly and in full.'

Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to confirm plans for new wind farms are not connected to Labour party donations by Ecotricity founder Dale Vince

Vince said in 2017 that a government decision to prevent new wind farms 'makes no sense and is a political choice'

Ecotricity, which currently has 74 turbines across 23 wind parks and recorded pre-tax profits of £44.7million in 2023, had 16 planning applications for wind farms refused before Labour won the election.

Campaigners are furious after plans to build one of Europe's largest solar farms were signed off by the Government.

Opposition to the 2,500-acre development in Cambridgeshire (the size of 1,500 football pitches), fuelled by concerns over farming, biodiversity and tourism, was overridden when Energy Secretary Ed Miliband gave the green light to energy company Sunnica's £600 million project.

Charlotte Cane, the local Liberal Democrat MP, described his decision as 'shocking'.

A second 2,000-acre project has been approved in Lincolnshire.

The company's most recent accounts stated: 'The group continues to lobby the UK government to pursue wider-reaching and more determined policies to address the climate emergency.'

In 2017, Vince said: 'Current government policy, to prevent new wind parks in England, makes no sense and is a political choice – because onshore energy isn't just good for the environment, it makes good economic sense too.'

The Daily Mail reported last week that thousands of onshore wind turbines could go up across the country under Labour.

In a statement, Vince said: 'The nonsensical ban on onshore wind added £15 billion to our energy bills since it was imposed – it made the energy crisis worse and lifting it is good for the whole country. I've donated money to Labour for many years, to help them compete and hopefully win the election. I believe they will make Britain a better country.

A Labour source said: 'The onshore wind ban put up energy bills for families and made Britain more energy insecure.

'By lifting the ban, this Labour Government is cutting bills for families and boosting Britain's energy independence.'"

 Australia may be striving to cut industrial emissions but will continue to export manufacturing jobs without a tax on carbon-rich imports, a summit has been told.

A mechanism covering the biggest emitters looks good but is an ""ineffective tool"" without a border tax, Vik Bansal, chief executive of construction materials giant Boral, warned on Thursday.

""We just move carbon emissions to Asia,"" he told the Australasian Emissions Reduction Summit in Sydney.

""But we live on one Earth.""

Mr Bansal also defended Boral's move to less ambitious emissions reduction targets, saying it was time to be ""pragmatic and realistic"".

Edwina Johnson, the senior official who led the overhaul of the beefed-up emissions safeguard mechanism, said the federal government was considering following Europe's lead in imposing a price on the carbon content of imported goods.

A so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism, or CBAM, could stop firms from shifting jobs to Indonesia and Malaysia where environmental standards are lower, and where ingredients for cement and steel - or future batteries - are cheaper.

A review of this ""carbon leakage"" and the feasibility of a CBAM, particularly for steel and cement, will report in a year's time.

But analysts warn that construction and housing costs will soar without cheap imports.

Chair of the new Net-Zero Economy Agency Greg Combet told the summit the task of decarbonising Australia's economy would require a level of investment and transformation equivalent to the period of post-war reconstruction.

Engineer Ben McGarry, global service leader of future energy at Aurecon, said technical people would be needed at worksites to figure out how to do it.

""One of my favourite cute factoids is that climate change is an anagram of mega technical,"" Dr McGarry said.

But in many cases the complex new technology behind ambitious decarbonisation plans does not yet exist, which means businesses must rely on carbon credits to comply with government requirements.

The purpose of carbon credits is widely misunderstood, according to summit host and Carbon Market Institute chief executive John Connor.

""I support efforts to give greater integrity to carbon crediting mechanisms, but they are not the enemy,"" Mr Connor said.

He said Australia should lift its game on emissions reduction and market integrity to support rapid change in the global economy.

However, there is growing scrutiny around how resources companies and other big emitters have access to unlimited carbon credits to meet climate promises, in what the fiercest opponents have called a ""scammer's dream"" or a ""fraud on the environment"".

Regulators have put firms on notice about false or misleading climate claims made to investors and consumers, particularly those that use offsets to wash emissions-rich business operations.

Deanne Stewart, chief executive of Aware Super, which manages $160 billion in superannuation accounts, said climate change was one of the biggest risks and there was a ""noisy minority"" who wanted no investment in fossil fuels.

""We really saw it dial-up when it was front and centre in the community when the bushfires and floods were happening,"" she said.

She said Aware Super used voting power on behalf of members to encourage ""laggards"" to disclose climate plans.

""We haven't done massive divestment at this point,"" Ms Stewart said.

""But as we get more and more forensic, and the sector pathways become more realistic, we'll start to move more into that action mode."""

 "" Farmers will not be able to recoup their investment made in the agriculture sector ""

To add insult to injury, the government has decided to reduce the subsidy given to the farmers on the purchase of chemical fertilisers which are widely used to increase agriculture productivity. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, a meeting of the Fertiliser Supply and Distribution Management Committee has decided to reduce the previously given subsidy of 70.82 per cent and maintain it at 59.04 per cent for the meantime.

The committee has also decided to gradually reduce the subsidy to around 50 per cent as per a statement issued by the ministry. As per the decision, urea fertilser will cost Rs 25 per kg, DPA (Di-ammonium Phosphate) fertiliser Rs 50 per kg and potash fertilser Rs 40 per kg. Before the decision, urea used to be sold at Rs 14 per kg, DAP at Rs 43 per kg and potash at Rs 31 per kg. The prices for the listed fertilisers have now increased by Rs 11, Rs 7 and Rs 9 per kg, respectively.

Earlier, the government was providing a subsidy of 80 per cent on urea, 60 per cent on DAP and 59 per cent on potash.

According to the ministry, the decision was made as per the request of the Ministry of Finance to reduce the subsidy given on the procurement of chemical fertilisers, stating that the prices of the chemical fertilisers have increased in the international market due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and disruption in their supply chain. The Finance Ministry has said the government was losing a big portion of the budget due to the high cost of imports and high subsidy given on the sale of the chemical fertilisers to the farmers. As per the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, the country needs to import as much as 520,000 metric tons of chemical fertilisers annually. The government has allocated a budget of Rs 38.5 billion to provide subsidies on chemical fertilisers in the current fiscal. The government has decided to procure 331,500 metric tons of chemical fertilisers from India under the G2G provision.

Although the ministry has claimed that the reduced subsidy on the chemical fertilisers will help curb their black marketing, it will have a negative impact on agriculture productivity, especially on paddy, wheat and maize, which are the major cereal crops.

Nepal grows just 40 per cent of its wheat needs, and the rest is imported, mainly from India, which also imposes a ban on its export at times when it faces a shortage in the domestic market. It is the small-scale farmers who will face the brunt of the reduced subsidy.

What about the subsidy given on the LPG, or cooking gas, which is sold at Rs 1,800 per cylinder? The actual price of a LPG cylinder, as per Nepal Oil Corporation, stands at Rs 2,500. Nepali farmers will not be able to recoup their investment made in the agriculture sector, which is already under stress due to imports of cheap food and climate change. It will not encourage youths to take up farming as a profession.

There are some areas where subsidy can be curtailed, and the money thus saved from them can be channelised to give a boost to the agriculture sector.

Reducing the given subsidy on the chemical fertilisers will mean the farmers will stop growing food, and the government will have to import more food from outside by spending more from the state coffers to feed its population."

 Facts and data show “three strikes and climate alarmism should be out,” climate truth-teller Steve Milloy told PJ Media. “But it’s still at bat and swinging,” propped up by the “fake news media.”

Junk Science’s Milloy explained the three biggest truths undermining the mainstream narrative in exclusive comments to PJ Media. [emphasis, links added]

“We are 35 years into climate alarmism, and we’ve had no global warming since 2015 despite 450 billion tons of emissions; no type of natural disaster correlates with emissions or warming; and no apocalyptic climate prediction has ever come true,” Milloy stated.

It’s time to admit the fraud.

“That’s three strikes and climate alarmism should be out. But it’s still at bat and swinging because the fake news media shares its leftist agenda and will not call it out,” Milloy added.

After all, governments can use climate change as a convenient excuse for increasing their power and control.

Milloy’s comments followed the publication of a new report.

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), The Heartland Institute, the Energy & Environmental (E&E) Legal Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the International Climate Science Coalition, and Truth in Energy and Climate issued their “Climate Fact Check: September 2023 Edition.” Milloy posted the report at ClimateRealism.com.

The first myth the groups attacked was the media apocalypse prophesying on “global warming.” They looked at data to determine if September did have record heat.

Based on NASA satellite data, September 2023 had the highest temperature anomaly (i.e., difference from average) on record. It was 0.9C warmer than the 1991-2020 average.

In contrast, the Temperature.global compilation of actual temperature measurements from surface stations has September only slightly warmer than the average monthly temperature of the past 8 years and 9 months, and far from the warmest month since January 2015.

Which data is more accurate and reliable? “NASA admits the surface stations are. There has still been no global warming since January 2015,” the report insisted. [That’s “because they directly measure the temperature where people reside”]

It also stated that “average global temperature” is “not an actual physical metric,” but merely a “flawed notion” used to fuel climate alarmism.

The report analyzed and fact-checked multiple media claims about the past month’s weather. Did the huge downpour in New York City break records and was it due to climate change?

No, the groups said, citing the New York Times’s records to disprove the claims.

As The New York Times asserted, is rainfall across the country becoming “more fearsome” due to global warming? The problem with that claim is that warmer air doesn’t cause “more intense rainfall,” the groups explained.

Are Alpine glaciers melting at a concerning rate? Perhaps, but it’s not because of man-made “emissions;” the report noted that the Alps were free of ice thousands of years ago, and the current receding has been ongoing for years, before modern industrial society.

The report further fact-checked claims around hurricanes, Antarctic ice, emissions and the “hottest summer” propaganda, Norwegian glaciers, and allegedly human-driven global warming.

It ends by providing context to an analysis supposedly proving man-driven global warming. If you add in the warming caused by “the series of El Niños,” it’s highly questionable that fossil fuels have warmed Earth “to any discernible extent.”

In fact, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data showed earlier this year that there hadn’t been global warming for eight years.

The “climate crisis” is an unscientific political crock."

 My publisher contacted me this week, drawing attention to a Wall Street Journal article claiming climate change is producing shortages of “the finer things in life,” like wine, coffee, cocoa, and olive oil. [emphasis, links added]

The implication was clear: your carbon footprint is causing the price of these commodities to sharply rise.

“Total bull-bleep,” I replied.

Specifically, the story speaks of the recent drought in West Africa, which has resulted in a cocoa shortage; dry spells in Vietnam, which have reduced coffee harvests; and parched Italian olive groves and grape vineyards, which were recently destroyed by wildfires.

None of these meteorological events has anything to do with the use of fossil fuels and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The truth is that these regions of the world are historically well-known for witnessing wild swings in otherwise natural weather patterns.

As I explain repeatedly in my new book Climate Cult: Exposing and Defeating Their War on Life, Liberty, and Property, such misinformation feeds into an elaborate propaganda campaign designed to frighten the developed world into demanding a carbon-neutral energy grid that would be about as reliable North Korea’s.

Let’s begin with West Africa, where the climate periodically exhibits large spatial and temporal variabilities that allow for recurrent droughts, some lasting hundreds of years.

In fact, the past couple of years of dry weather pales in comparison to the West African droughts in the 1970s and ’80s.

As for cocoa production, a reality missing from the discussion is that global consumers are demanding more cocoa than ever, so a blip in production impacts retail price and availability like never before.

The recent drought in Vietnam is quite serious, but I’m happy to report it’s not being caused by your SUV.

While the lack of rain in parts of Southeast Asia is the worst since the 1930s (a decade which remains the hottest on record throughout much of the world), the drought is associated with an El Nino weather pattern.

El Nino and its sister La Nina are ancient occurrences that possess the dynamics to both enhance or diminish precipitation, depending on a variety of quite ordinary atmospheric circumstances.

Wildfires feeding on extremely dry vegetation have certainly taken a recent toll on olive groves in Italy and drought has impacted wine production there as well.

The journal Nature recently published a study claiming, “Climate change is affecting grape yield, composition, and wine quality. As a result, the geography of wine production is changing.” However, the publication’s editorial bias seems to have caused them to ignore the historical record.

The worst drought in modern Italy occurred in the 1920s. However, going back further, that region’s most catastrophic precipitation deficiency began in the 1530s and lasted the better part of a decade.

It was so extreme that Protestant reformer Martin Luther wondered if it was a sign of the end times. Clergy in Germany, Italy, and England urged the people to beg God for forgiveness and pray for the deliverance of rain.

As I explain in my book, those pushing the climate agenda employ ad hominem arguments that appeal to raw emotions rather than intellect.

And, as I also detail, those on the left aren’t fond of examining history. For them, Karl Marx stated it best in his 1844 book, The Holy Family: “History does nothing; it possesses no immense wealth; it wages no battles.”

 LOS ANGELES: Disastrous flooding could hit parts of California this weekend, forecasters warned Friday, as the eighth storm in succession barreled in over land already too waterlogged to soak up any more rain. The most populous US state has been pummeled by near-record downpours over a very wet three weeks, which have already caused flooding, landslides and widespread power outages. At least 19 people are known to have died as communities struggle to cope with the constant deluge.

On Friday yet another system moved in, with forecasters warning the Monterey Peninsula could be cut off and the whole city of Salinas-home to 160,000 people-flooded. ""The entire lower Salinas Valley will have disastrous flooding,"" the National Weather Service said.

""The entire city of Salinas is in danger of flooding. Most of Castroville will flood. All roads near the Salinas River will be flooded and impassable. 90,000 acres or more of agricultural land in the Salinas Valley will have disastrous flooding. ""Many roads, homes and agricultural land areas in the Salinas Valley will have major flood damage."" The Salinas River, already swollen by weeks of torrential rain, was expected to peak some time Friday, breaching its banks in a flood that could last until Sunday.

Kelley O'Connell said the bursting of a levee near her home had worried her. ""If they release water from the dams or we get more rain, we're just a field away,"" she told the San Francisco Chronicle as she collected sandbags.

Evacuation orders and warnings were widespread, with forecasters saying major roads could become impassable-including highways that link the Monterey Peninsula with the rest of the county. ""Residents both on the peninsula and in the Salinas area should expect to be cut off for two to three days,"" Monterey County officials said earlier this week.

Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto told reporters Thursday that floodwater could strand people. ""This is a slow-moving event"" and not all places will be impacted at once, she said. ""The river crests at different times.""

Resident John Guru said he was taking no chances, with four days' supplies at home and two days' worth in his car in case he is caught out on the road. ""I'm not sure how bad it's going to be,"" he told the Monterey Herald. ""I will find a place if needed and do whatever it takes,"" he said, adding: ""This is crazy, I was not anticipating anything like this.""

Snow

Workers have rushed out in between storms to clear up some of the mess left behind, shoveling mud from roads even in the heart of Los Angeles. Crews have cut up felled trees, and heavy machinery have been drafted in to move rockslides.

Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have been left without power at various times-sometimes repeatedly-as rickety infrastructure has taken a battering. And it's not over yet, forecasters say. ""The ongoing unsettled weather in the West associated with the active Atmospheric River pattern unfortunately continues into this weekend with another couple rounds of heavy precipitation forecast,"" the NWS said.

Over the mountains, that precipitation was falling as snow, with more than three feet (a meter) expected in the Sierra Nevada range, making travel dangerous or impossible, even as thousands of skiers and snowboarders head for fresh powder over the Martin Luther King, Jr Day holiday weekend.

Among those who have died in the last three weeks were drivers who were found in submerged cars, people struck by falling trees, a husband and wife killed in a rockfall, and people whose bodies were discovered in floodwaters. Winter storms are not unusual in California, where most of the annual rain comes in a fairly concentrated period.

But global warming, driven by the industrial era's unchecked use of fossil fuels, is supercharging storms, making them wetter and wilder. At the same time, the western United States is aridifying, with much of the region in its 23rd year of drought. Hydrologists say the recent rains are helping-California has received an average of almost nine inches (23 centimeters) of rain since late December-but are not a fix. ""A few weeks of storms is not enough in this drought for California, but it certainly is nice. It's certainly making a good dent,"" Jay Lund, director of University of California, Davis, told the Chronicle."
EN_UA_000104.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Senate blocks sanctions aimed at stopping Nord Stream 2 pipeline 

 The Senate blocked a measure to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.

The measure by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas failed on a vote of 55 to 44. It needed 60 votes to pass.

The vote was held open for several hours as Democrats grappled with a setback on unrelated voting rights legislation.

“Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy as energy blackmail,” Cruz said Thursday on the Senate floor. President Vladimir Putin has done that “openly, brazenly and laughingly and absolutely nothing happened,” Cruz said.

Opponents of the measure said it would damage U.S. cooperation with Germany and other NATO partners as they try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces deployed on its borders.

The bill “would undermine the current diplomatic situation,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who had introduced earlier sanctions proposals with Cruz. “We are in a very different situation right now” than when two earlier bills were passed.

The Biden administration also has argued that imposing new sanctions on the undersea pipeline now could undercut the US’s ability to persuade other European nations to join in severe economic penalties later if Russia invades Ukraine.

The legislation “will not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “Instead, it will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home.”

The White House backed an alternative plan from Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, that would make the sanctions contingent on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Nearly 40 senators have signed on to that bill.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the pipeline is what’s divisive. Unlike an older Nord Stream pipeline, the new one bypasses Ukraine.

“The government of Germany should have shelved this project itself a long time ago,” McConnell said. “These sanctions, like the prior Nord Stream 2 sanctions that had overwhelming bipartisan support here in Congress, are not about driving a wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is the wedge.”

McConnell called for a stronger stance against Russia, saying on the Senate floor that the US should extend additional humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.

“We must not pull our punches out of some fear of provoking Putin,” he said. “What will encourage Putin is if he senses American weakness.”

Construction of the new pipeline is essentially complete, but Germany has yet to issue the certification required for it to begin operating.

EN_UA_000543.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Ukraine Appeals for Calm, Says Russian Invasion Not Imminent 

 A top Ukrainian official has appealed for calm as he reassured the nation that an invasion from neighboring Russia was not imminent—despite officials acknowledging there is a real threat as NATO allies have ramped up defenses in the Baltic Sea region this week.

Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, said on Monday that at this time, “there are no grounds to believe” that Moscow is preparing an invasion very soon and there is no need for citizens “to have [their] bags packed.”

“Don’t worry, sleep well,” he said, adding that “there are risky scenarios. They’re possible and probable in the future,” though at this time “such a threat doesn’t exist.”

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is “under control,” while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, “which would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.”

Reznikov’s and Zelensky’s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.

“Our partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,” the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.

Moscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing “hysteria” and is putting out information “laced with lies.”

Peskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of “fomenting tensions” around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.

Western concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia–Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement have stalled."

 Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday dismissed claims from the United Kingdom that Moscow wanted to install a pro-Russia leader in Kyiv while it considers whether to invade the beleaguered Eastern European nation.

The UK further suggested that the Kremlin currently is “maintain[ing] links with” former officials including Serhiy Arbuzov, a former deputy prime minister of Ukraine between 2012 to 2014; Andriy Kluyev, first deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2012; former deputy chief of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Vladimir Sivkovich; and Mykola Azarov, the prime minister of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014.

What’s more, the UK statement alleges that former Ukrainian Parliament Member Yevhen Murayev “is being considered” by Russia’s leadership “as a potential candidate” to lead the Ukrainian government.

The UK did not provide evidence for its claim. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss asserted, however, that Moscow must deescalate tensions and “end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy.”

But over the weekend, Russian officials said the UK’s Foreign Office should stop publishing “nonsense” and “disinformation.”

The embassy further alleged that the UK’s strategy is to accuse “Russia of plotting ‘inevitable’ invasion of Ukraine and try to play the role of an ideological leader, defending itself from ‘autocrats’ and aiming to ‘free the world.’”

Murayev, meanwhile, responded to the UK’s statement by dismissing the claim.

In a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said the allegations should be taken seriously, acknowledged there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine. But he added that Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass.

Therefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible,” he said.

On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne appeared to endorse the UK assessment that the Kremlin is plotting to install a Moscow-friendly puppet administration.

“This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” Horne said. “The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.”"

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

 After Russia announced Tuesday that it will pull out some troops from near the Ukrainian border, top NATO officials expressed that they are “cautiously optimistic” for a de-escalation of tensions.

“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue. This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.

Russia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.

NATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.

“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”

The Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.

“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement, according to Reuters.

On Monday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian media the United States and the West are trying to “spark a conflict” with recent statements about a possible invasion.

“Look, if we planned any war against Ukraine, the media would have behaved completely differently. Because the media is the modern war’s bombardments,” he said.

France said it had yet to confirm the return of some Russian troops to bases, though this would be a positive sign. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the latest Western diplomatic mission to defuse the crisis, met Putin in the Kremlin.

Over the past weekend and on Monday, White House officials called on Americans to leave Ukraine and asserted that an invasion could occur in the near future. No evidence was provided for the second claim.

The U.S. Department of State also shut down its embassy in Kyiv and moved it to Lviv, located in the western part of Ukraine.

“We are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,” Blinken added, noting that “the path for diplomacy” is available.

Around the same time, confusion was sparked when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a statement on Facebook that said Russia would invade on Feb. 16. However, his office later said that he made the remarks sarcastically in an apparent attempt to make light of various Western intelligence reports suggesting an imminent invasion."

 Facebook now warns users NOT to ‘call for Putin assassination’ after controversial rule change

FACEBOOK users are now banned from calling for violence against heads of state.

Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – on Sunday clarified its recent violent speech policy to specifically not include calls for the death of a head of state.

The new announcement by Meta is likely in response to the violent posts users have been sharing towards Russian President Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state… So, in order to remove any ambiguity about our stance, we are further narrowing our guidance to make explicit that we are not allowing calls for the death of a head of state on our platforms,"" Meta global affairs President Nick Clegg said, per Reuters.

Meta's clarification came shortly after the company revealed last week that it would take a more relaxed stance on users calling for violence against Russian forces in the context of the Ukraine invasion.

""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

However, it appears that Meta's initial policy sparked confusion among both Facebook and Instagram users on what type of speech is exactly permitted.

Along with banning violent calls against state leaders, the American tech company also emphasized that their new policy does not allow for hate speech towards Russian civilians.

""We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,"" Clegg said.

""Meta stands against Russophobia. We have no tolerance for calls for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or any kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

 Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has promised he is ""ready to fight"" following reports of multiple Ukrainian mayors being kidnapped by the invading Russian military.

Ukraine has accused Russian forces of capturing mayors in Dniprorudne and Melitopol in recent days, sparking concerns that additional mayors could be kidnapped next, including the mayor of the country's capital city.

Klitschko, who was a highly regarded world heavyweight boxing champion before entering politics, insisted during a Fox News interview on Monday that any Russian soldiers who hope to capture him would find that their task was ""not easy.""

""I am ready to fight,"" Klitschko said after America Reports host John Roberts asked him about a potential kidnapping attempt. ""This will be not easy to do that ... nobody feels safety in our country right now in this very difficult situation. Everyone [is] ready to fight, ready to defend our city.""

""I am not worried about kidnap,"" he added. ""I am ready to fight, that's why I have weapons, that's why it's my hometown and I want to defend the interest of my citizens, the interest of my home, the interest of my family.""

Ukrainian officials announced the kidnapping of Dniprorudne Mayor Matveev Sergeevich on Sunday, while they said that Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was captured two days earlier. Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.

While commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that ""the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.""

Klitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of ""un-human"" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.

""War also has rules,"" said Klitschko. ""But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.""

""Its actually against all rules,"" Klitschko continued. ""We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.""

Following Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.

""That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,"" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. ""Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket. Lives are getting lost, that's the war that Russia started.""

According to the Ukrainian government, Monday's Russian strikes on Kyiv also included a missile hitting a nine-story residential building, leaving two dead and three others hospitalized.

Newsweek reached out to the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C., for comment.

 Putin may ABANDON siege of Kyiv and try to blitz other cities into submission after losing thousands of troops

MAD Vlad Putin may abandon plans to capture Kyiv as countless Russian soldiers would be killed, spooks now believe.

Spies say the death toll of an all-out assault on Ukraine's capital may even be too much for the evil Kremlin tyrant to stomach.

A Western official said: ""An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders, would be a fairly costly business.

""And I think there comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.

They said Putin's forces were getting ""bogged down"" around the outskirts of Kyiv after suffering ambushes by heroic Ukrainians.

As many as 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the bloody fighting so far as Putin's battleplan continues to fall apart.

Spies fear the crazed despot could resort to even more brutal firepower that could blow entire cities to smithereens.

A western official said there was ""big concern"" he could create another Grozny, the Chechan city pummelled in the 1990s.

Soldiers fed Putin's lie that they would be welcomed as liberators are struggling to occupy cities because of resistance.

The official said the plan was to ""walk in, decapitate the local leadership and receive the adulation of a welcoming population"".

They added Russia would likely resort to ""brutalise the population"" and ""destroy"" the cities to save face.

Failure to completely capture a single Ukrainian is humiliating Putin who has lost four top generals and has not ""achieved a strategic breakthrough at any point"".

His legendary paratroopers have also been picked off by plucky Ukrainians.

Taras Kuzio, an Associate Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, says dozens of Russian paratroopers were killed in their doomed bid to take Hostomel airport.

Dramatic footage also shows a Russian tank being blown to bits.

 NEW YORK—An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program to protest the war in Ukraine was released from custody Tuesday and fined about $270, but still could face a prison sentence.

Marina Ovsyannikova told reporters she was not allowed to sleep while held in police custody and that she was interrogated for 14 hours.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked behind the presenter during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded earlier, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video and remains under investigation for the on-air protest under a law banning dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces. The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

Ovsyannikova, whose father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian, spent the night in police custody.

“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn’t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn’t provide any legal support,” Ovsyannikova said.

The court ordered her to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war."

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

ajor international organizations issued an appeal Wednesday for urgent measures to deal with rising food insecurity in poor countries, including financing to support farmers and increase food supplies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

""It is critical to quickly provide support for food insecure countries in a coordinated manner,"" the heads of the IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization and UN World Food Program said in a joint statement.

Protests have erupted in some countries over high prices, and the statement said, ""The increase in food prices and supply shocks can fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict.""

The organizations called on the international community to provide financing for emergency food supplies, a safety net for poor families and farmers, and to increase agricultural production.

They also called for ""open trade"" that avoids export restrictions or ""humanitarian food purchases.""

While the poor nations are most vulnerable to the crisis, middle income countries increasingly are at risk, the statement said.

""Surging fertilizer prices along with significant cuts in global supplies have important implications for food production in most countries, including major producers and exporters, who rely heavily on fertilizer imports,"" they said.

IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass, WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and WFP director David Beasley issued the statement before next week's meeting of the IMF and World Bank.

Increased fragility

The war in Ukraine came as the global economy was trying to right itself following the COVID-19 pandemic, while navigating supply chain snarls that created shortages and a surge in inflation.

New lockdowns in China have added further uncertainty to the recovery.

Ukraine is a key source of grain while Russia is a major producer of energy and fertilizer needed for agriculture.

Protestors in Peru have taken to the streets to demand government action, as did people in Sri Lanka, where the government on Tuesday announced it was defaulting on its US$51 billion in foreign debt.

Poverty rose sharply during the pandemic, and the World Bank warns that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide.

""Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide and pushing millions more into poverty,"" the officials said.

""Increased fragility and conflict pose persistent harm to people around the globe.""

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

Separately, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia knows that NATO wants to “militarize everything within reach,” Interfax news agency reported."

 Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil

Caxias do Sul (Brazil) (AFP) – When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbors thought she was throwing a bomb.

Issued on:

But her ""weapon"" isn't one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil.

Thousands of kilometers (miles) from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on May 1 and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul.

With two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 -- more than double the second-place United States.

""In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,"" said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee.

""One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV. Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,"" he told AFP.

'Really want' peace

Ukraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport.

Its Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says.

Ukraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion.

The team's success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event -- behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion.

""I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I'm very proud to represent my country,"" said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering.

""I'm happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,"" said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton.

'Didn't hear the sirens'

Filimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes.

""A lot of deaf people died because they didn't hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,"" she said.

Her teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games.

""When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,"" said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson.

She finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind.

""It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,"" she said.

""After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,"" she added.

""But I don't know if that will be possible.""

 Although Ukrainians are doing everything they can to drive out the Russians, ""no one today can predict how long this war will last"", President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says.

""This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum,"" he said on Friday in his nightly video address to the nation.

""This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world.""

He said he was thankful to those who were working to strengthen the sanctions on Russia and increase military and financial support to Ukraine.

""This is the only recipe for protecting freedom in the face of the Russian invasion. And for Western countries, this is not simply an expense. This is not about accounting, it's about the future.""

Zelenskiy said Ukraine on Friday shot down the 200th Russian aircraft of the war and he noted Russia's heavy losses in tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and drones.

""And for what? So that the Lenin statue can stand for a bit longer in temporarily occupied Genichesk? There is and can be no other result for Russia.""

Russian forces in April restored the Lenin statue in Genichesk, a town in the southern Kherson region.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine was engaged in ""very difficult negotiations"" to try to evacuate the wounded fighters trapped in the Mariupol steelworks.

""We're talking about a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate all of the rest, each of our defenders. We have already brought in everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediators.""

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces had retaken towns and villages from Russian troops. He said work was under way to restore electricity, running water, telephone communications and social services.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21 accused Western powers of engaging in nuclear blackmail and put his country onto an enhanced wartime footing, ordering a partial military mobilization and vowing to use “all means available” in the event of a threat against Russia and its people.

“Those that allow such statements shall be reminded that our country also has various weapons of mass destruction,” including some that are more advanced than those in NATO’s arsenal, he added, according to a translation of his remarks by Sky News.

Accusations Against the WestPutin accused the West of seeking to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy” Russia, according to an official Kremlin translation of part of his speech, which was posted on the Kremlin website.

Claiming that Western powers had concocted these plans long ago, Putin said they fomented anti-Russia terrorist activity in the Caucasus, moved “NATO’s offensive infrastructure” near his country’s borders, nurtured “hatred for Russia for decades,” and intended to set up Ukraine as an “anti-Russia bridgehead.”

Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian state television that Putin’s mobilization order would encompass reservists but wouldn’t include students or anyone without prior military service.

The Russian leadership has been reluctant to order a broad military mobilization, portraying the invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” that’s limited in scope.

Putin’s order marks the first time since World War Two that a military mobilization of Russian citizens has been invoked.

Critical ReactionsPutin’s move drew critical reactions from Western leaders and Ukrainian officials.

Bridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, took to Twitter to describe Putin’s order as a sign of “weakness” and “failure.”

Britain’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace was cited by The Scotsman as saying that Putin’s order amounts to an admission of failure.

“Putin’s breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, are an admission that his invasion is failing,” Wallace said.

“No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning the war, the international community are united, and Russia is becoming a pariah,” he added.

Anxious investors fled risk assets following Putin’s speech, while safe havens like bonds and the U.S. dollar rose."

Recently, some readers have complained to me that we are covering the Ukraine situation too closely, saying they are bored with the topic.

In fact, I’m not really covering it that closely. I’m really just giving the broad strokes, and giving people a basis upon which they can do further investigation into what is going on if they are so inclined.

If readers find the coverage boring, they can skip over it. There is a lot of other stuff on this site. I am covering the Ukraine the exact right amount. I am obligated to do this because so few outlets are covering the war with any truth or honesty. In the English language, the pro-Russia perspective is very difficult to find, with most conservatives who are against the war simply saying that they don’t care either way. “I do care and I actively support those fighting against the Washington and Brussels elite” is an important perspective that must be in the public conversation.

Someone is going to win this conflict, and someone is going to lose. The stakes could not be any higher. The future of the entire world now hinges on the outcome of this conflict. This is the single most consequential military conflict in all of human history.

If Russia loses, the Putin government will collapse, and the US will be able to steamroll the country, break it apart into several pieces. From there, the US will have China isolated, and then eventually break them. This will result in the final establishment of a singular world order run by the Jewish power centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel.

If the US loses the war, we are looking at a freefall collapse of the Western economic and military order, a rising China, and a reshuffling of the entire order of power on the planet earth.

The reason I support Russia is that I want the US empire to collapse. The reason I want the US empire to collapse is that I do not believe that the US empire is compatible with freedom in the US, and believe that we can only reestablish freedom in this country when the empire falls.

If the dollar goes down and the US can no longer export debt to the world through the dollar reserve system, the US government will no longer have the ability to micromanage the lives of American citizens. They will not have the resources (you have to have a lot of excess money to inflict your will on the entire population, which is one reason why people are so much freer in third world countries). We will be free, and we will then be able to return to the natural order in our society, without Jews controlling everything, without trannies, without deadly fake vaccines, without mass immigration, without feminism.

Those are the stakes."

 NUSA DUA – The European Council president urged global powers Tuesday to intensify pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine, including Moscow's biggest supporter, China, saying that this week's meeting of the world's largest economies was crucial to stopping Moscow's push ""to use food and energy as weapons.”

Charles Michel, speaking to reporters on the first day of the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, said the nine-month war waged by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has disrupted lives across the world, as food and energy prices surge and economies stagnate.

“Russia’s war impacts us all, no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East, and the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the U.N. charter,” Michel said. “The Kremlin has decided to weaponize food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability.”

Europe, Michel said, is working to help Ukraine, a big food exporter before the war, increase its shipments, and is also trying to address disruptions in fertilizer supplies and rising prices. EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.

“This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world. It’s a battle for the U.N. charter. It’s a battle for the international law. It's a battle for the idea that this is not acceptable to try to change by force internationally recognized borders.”

Michel said he had no plans to meet with the most senior Russian present in Bali, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

China, the world's second biggest economy, has largely refrained from public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.

Instead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present “to put more pressure on Russia.""

After a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and “reaffirmed our shared belief” that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is “totally unacceptable” — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.

Michel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.

“We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,” which Europe was very dependent on, “with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future. That's why it's important to rebalance the relationship,” Michel said."

 Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Council after reports that a Russian missile that hit Polish territory killed two civilians.

The emergency meeting was announced by cabinet spokesman Piotr Muller on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. Muller did not reveal what the committee was due to discuss and did not offer further comment to Reuters news agency.

The committee talks, which will include senior members of Poland’s government and its intelligence services, come following unverified reports that stray Russian missiles intended for Ukraine have hit a Polish village, killing two civilians.

According to Radio ZET, a Polish commercial radio station, “two stray rockets fell in the village of Przewodów in the Lublin province near the border with Ukraine.”

Russian authorities have denied that the missiles that struck Poland came from Russia.

The station further reported that two people had died at the scene. The Polish military, the police, and the prosecutor’s office have been called to the scene.

Military planes are also understood to have been scrambled.

Polish authorities are yet to confirm media reports that Russian missiles were responsible for the explosion but they were substantiated by a senior U.S. intelligence official to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday evening.

“The causes of this incident are not known at the moment,” said Marcin Lebiedowicz, a spokesman for the Poviat Fire Brigade in Hrubieszów

“We received a report of an explosion in the drying yard. In fact, upon arrival, we confirm that something like this happened. Two people died on the spot. At the moment, we are securing the scene and lighting the area of the action,” he added.

Kurier Lubelski, a regional Polish news outlet from the affected area has attempted numerous times on Tuesday to verify the details with state officials to no avail.

At 7 p.m. local time, the outlet was told by the local mayor’s office: “I can’t say anything about it. However, there is definitely no need to arouse anxiety. Let’s wait for the exact findings of the services.”

At 7.30 .p.m. local time, the news outlet attempted to speak again with Marcin Lebiedowicz for further information on the incident.

“I’m not allowed to give any information at the moment. I suggest contacting other services,” he replied.

The local police department’s spokesperson has not been available for comment to local media, but Voivode of Lublin Lech Sprawka confirmed he was on his way to the accident site.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that “If Poland confirms that the missiles also hit its territory, this will be a further escalation by Russia. We stand firmly behind our EU and NATO ally.”

Latvia’s Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks stated that the “criminal Russian regime” had hit Poland with missiles, although it is unclear what evidence he has to back his statement at this time.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said “every inch of NATO territory must be defended.”

Hungarian government spokesperson, Zolan Kovacs, also confirmed via Twitter that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had convened an emergency meeting of Hungary’s Defense Council for Tuesday evening “in response to missiles hitting the territory of Poland.”

A U.K. Foreign Office spokesman told Sky News: “We are investigating these reports and liaising closely with allies.”

Russian military launched a strong aerial assault on Ukraine on Tuesday, targeting key cities including Lviv, just 80 kilometers from the Polish border.

If reports are accurate, it will be the first time Russian projectiles have reached Poland."

 Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure could impact the Eastern European nation's neighbors, a key Ukrainian energy official said on Tuesday.

Nearly nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has continued to ramp up its attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure in recent weeks, targeting cities across Ukraine including the capital city of Kyiv.

Despite the vast size of the Russian military, its troops have struggled to achieve substantial gains in Ukraine. Meanwhile, throughout the fall, Kyiv has retaken control of formerly occupied territories, most recently recapturing control of Kherson, a major city in the nation's southern region.

Concerns about attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure have grown as winter approaches, and these attacks threaten to leave millions of Ukrainians without power throughout the winter, which could see dangerously low temperatures.

On Tuesday, Russia hit Ukraine with its latest attack on its infrastructure, which Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko described as the ""most massive shelling"" since the war began on February 24, 2022.

""Today again Russia strikes large-scale missile strikes on energy facilities. This is the most massive shelling of the energy system since the beginning of the war,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""This attack can have an impact not only on the energy system of Ukraine, but also on the energy systems of some of our neighbors.""

Galushchenko said the attack hit Ukraine's generators and electricity transmission system, describing the attack as ""another attempt of terrorist revenge"" in which Russia tried to ""inflict maximum damage on our energy system on the eve of winter.""

One Ukrainian neighbor reported outages due to the attack.

Moldovan Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development Andrei Spînu wrote in a Telegram post that the Russian attacks led to power outages across the country. The lines did not suffer damage due to the attack but were disconnected due to a safety measure.

""As a result of Russia's bombing of the Ukrainian energy system in the last hour, one of the power lines that provide electricity transport for our country was disconnected in automatic mode (automatic load shedding according to frequency). This has led to massive power outages across the country,"" he wrote.

Moldovan authorities restored power for most of its residents later Tuesday, but Spînu warned that Russian attacks against Ukraine could lead to further outages.

""Russian aggression against Ukraine directly affects our country as well. The risks of power outages remain high. Any bombing by Russia against Ukrainian power plants may lead to a repeat of today's situation,"" he wrote.

Newsweek reached out to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy for comment.

 The G20 leaders are set to state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the summit in Bali, a British newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing a draft communique agreed by diplomats involved in the negotiations to finalise the document.

The key line on the Ukraine conflict in the draft communique almost echoes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that 'today's era is not of war'.

There have been a series of negotiations among the diplomats of the G20 member countries over the formulation relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and China are also members of the G-20 which operate on the principle of consensus.

In his bilateral meeting with Putin in Uzbekistan on September 16, Modi said ""today's era is not of war"" and nudged him to end the conflict.

The Indian delegation played a big role in achieving consensus among member states over the wording criticising the Russian invasion, the Financial Times (FT) said, citing two unnamed officials with knowledge of the negotiations.

Prime Minister Modi and several leaders of the G20 countries touched upon the Ukraine crisis in their remarks at the grouping's summit that began in Bali on Tuesday.

World leaders will state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the G20 summit in Bali, according to a draft communique agreed by diplomats that also condemned threats of nuclear weapons use, the newspaper said.

""The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war,"" the draft statement said, according to FT.

The communique was agreed by country delegates on Monday night but must still be signed off by G20 leaders at the two-day summit, the report said.

The G20 ""will make clear that Russia's war is wreaking havoc for people everywhere"", the report said, quoting a senior US official.

An Indonesian official said discussions on the draft statement were ""still dynamic"" and might change, it said.

In his address at the summit, Modi on Tuesday referred to his repeated call for resolving the crisis through talks.

""I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine. Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world,"" he said.

Since the Ukraine conflict began in February, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Russian President Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a number of times.

In a phone conversation with Zelenskyy on October 4, Modi said that there can be ""no military solution"" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts.

India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue."

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

Eight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.

In recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and

a separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.

The media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

***

This background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.

This comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.

It also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.

****

The underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.

Today, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.

The 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.

It is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.

It is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.

According to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):

“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)

The Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:

European governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.

European Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.

In Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)

On July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

EU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)

 The conflict in Ukraine may end either by diplomatic or military means. However, it can be possible only after Moscow achieves its goals.

""An opportunity to resolve the conflict will appear only when Ukraine ceases to pose a threat to Russia and discriminate against Russian-speaking Ukrainians,” Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Ambassador to the UN Security Council, said at a briefing at the UN Security Council.

""If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for such a scenario. If not, then our objectives will be achieved by military means,"" he added.

Russia is not fighting against the Ukrainian people. Russia is fighting against the criminal nationalist regime that came to power in 2014” after the coup in Kyiv, the diplomat said.

""The new Ukrainian leadership is trying to purge the country of everything connected with Russia and glorify Nazi accomplices. <…>

""The Kyiv regime and its most rabid patrons have forgotten the meaning of the word ""peace."" It is no coincidence that the European Union finances arms supplies to Kyiv through the European Peace Fund, without even thinking about how blasphemous it sounds and looks. <…>

""Ukraine, in fact, has become a NATO PMC. It gets money, weapons and intelligence data. Ukraine receives instructions which targets to attack and where. It is the Ukrainian people who suffer from this in the first place and the people of Ukraine are forced to fight for the sake of someone else's tasks.""

However, the Russian Ambassador to the UN said, everything could have ended differently for Ukraine, if Kyiv had implemented the now-defunct Minsk Agreements that were signed in 2014 and 2015 ""in an attempt to pave the way for peace by granting the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics a special status as part of the Ukrainian state"".

Former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and ex-president of France Francois Hollande later confirmed that neither sitting President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, nor his predecessors, nor France and Germany, who were involved in the Minks Agreements process, never intended to fulfil them. This diplomatic process served only as a ""smoke screen"" behind which they secretly armed Ukraine against Russia.

Merkel's and Hollande's confessions caused an uproar in Moscow. Russian officials called them a formalisation of betrayal. Interestingly, though, no one in the West was embarrassed about those statements. It appears that the West continues implementing its strategy.

In December, Ukraine put forward the idea of the Global Peace Summit based on Zelensky's ""peace formula."" In that formula, among other things, Zelensky demanded Russia should withdraw its troops from all Ukrainian territories.

Moscow dismissed the plan as it ignored the new status of Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson, Zaporozhye (Zaporizhzhia) regions and Crimea as part of Russia.

Now Kyiv has a new ""idea"":

The Ukrainian administration wants to hold a ""peace summit"" at UN headquarters in New York on February 24 (one year anniversary since the start of the special operation), but without Moscow's participation.

According to The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy was planning to visit New York in February to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine would like the UN General Assembly to adopt two resolutions:

""Peace talks could start after the UN General Assembly passes the resolutions or after the proposed summit is held,"" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova said.

 KREMLIN propagandists have called for London to be “turned to dust” after Ukraine said it would use British missiles.

The deranged ranting was part of a nightly show dedicated to pro-war discussion on state TV that’s hosted by a notorious Putin acolyte.

Last night’s show featured discussion of a report in The Sun saying Kyiv said it would use the Storm Shadow missile if the UK was willing to provide it.

At one point host Vladimir Solovyov bizarrely raised his hand as if to cast a spell, then stared manically at the camera and said: “London will turn to dust! To dust.”

Mad Vlad's mouthpiece, his face twisted with rage, then switches to English and begins shouting: “Burn in hell!” and “Flames!”

Solovyov was responding to a panellist who made a wildly exaggerated claim about a news story published by The Sun.

He fumed: “The British press is saying ‘We’ll give them hell! I’m quoting verbatim from their most popular paper The Sun.

“They all regard this as completely fine - ‘Russians can and need to be killed’. They’re saying that constantly.

“There’s one problem with Russians. They won’t give up as easily as that.”

The clip and its translation was tweeted by BBC Monitoring, which regularly posts on pro-Kremlin propaganda shows.

It comes after Volodymyr Zelensky asked for 600mph British missiles when he visited the UK recently with a shopping list of weapons.

Ukrainian defence sources Kyiv would be prepared to use the missiles to strike Crimea

It followed a warning from Zelensky that longer-range weapons from western allies would allow Ukraine to take the battle to areas occupied by Russian.

""It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its airbases deep in the occupied territories,” he said during his visit.

In response, Rishi Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to military support for Ukraine.

The Government is still weighing up whether to send deadly Harpoon anti-ship missiles or surface-to-air Storm Shadows to arm Ukrainian defenders.

After Germany finally agree to send tanks, Solovyov, and other Kremlin propagandists threatened nuclear strikes on the West.

In a similar rant he claimed it meant Germany had joined the war.

Solovyov said: ""It’s time to send a clear, resolute message that we now consider Germany a direct party to the conflict, rekindling memories of World War Two.

“German tanks appearing [in Ukraine] will definitely mean we consider German territory, military bases and other sites as legitimate targets.”

Raging Moscow TV pundit Yevgeny Satanovsky said warheads should be launched on the German capital Berlin and the country’s parliament, the Bundestag.

“Flat, slightly radioactive, melted-down ground [will remain in its place].”

 Moscow: Russia will ask the UN Security Council for an investigation into Nord Stream gas pipelines explosions in September last year for which it blames the US.

The Russian parliament’s committee for international relations has introduced the motion regarding this and is expected to get approval by the State Duma later this week.

What does the proposal say?

According to a report by TASS, the proposal calls the Baltic Sea pipelines blasts as “an act of international terrorism” and a “monstrous sabotage.""

It seeks from the United Nations to hold accountable both - who gave the order for the explosions and those who carried it out.

“The criminal act has threatened the security of all Eurasia,” the proposal stated.

Giving the reference to the report of American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, the lawmakers blamed US President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it “gave the illegal order and bears full responsibility for the multi-billion-dollar damage to the infrastructure of Russia, Germany, France and the Netherlands.""

Don’t Miss: US planted explosives along Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022 under Biden supervision, claims Seymour Hersh

They further described the pipeline sabotage as inflicting long-term damage to the security, economy and environment of the entire region.

Hersh in his report alleged that the Nord Stream gas pipelines were damaged in a joint operation between the US and Norway.

According to him, divers trained at the US Navy’s Diving and Salvage Centre in Florida, planted C4 explosives on three Nord Stream pipelines in June 2022. They were detonated after three months using a sonar buoy which broadcast a signal that triggered the bombs.

 Paranoid Putin tries to hide ‘cancer battle’ by making bombshell medical files SECRET as weak ruler fears being toppled’

PANICKED Vladimir Putin has dramatically classified bombshell data which appears to prove he has been treated for cancer.

Rumours have persistently swirled that the tyrant, 70, is ""critically ill"" - fuelled by his bloated face and trembling legs.

Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm Putin has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson's disease.

Now the panicked Russian leader has desperately classified medical files that reveal an apparent cancer battle as he fears a coup inside the Kremlin.

A loophole previously allowed investigative journalists to show that the dictator was constantly accompanied by a top thyroid cancer specialist and other medics.

Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov, of Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi.

More on Putin

The proof of Putin’s treatment by cancer doctors was deduced from the existence of contracts with the hospital which were listed on a Russian public procurement website.

Now such details have been made top secret, preventing public knowledge of current and future contracts.

Earlier it was seen that Putin was accompanied by between six and 13 medical specialists on his trips.

Medics were also seen to be on standby near his favourite official residences outside Moscow, for example in Sochi and Valdai.

Most read in The Sun

The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer.

Medics appeared to be thyroid and ENT specialists.

It comes after it was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin's residences - and train stations nearby.

The blocking of data of such contracts was revealed by Sirena, part of Radio Liberty.

KREMLIN COUP?

The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putin’s health during the war against Ukraine.

Symptoms of thyroid cancer include the appearance of a thick nodule in the thyroid area; hoarseness of voice; difficulty swallowing; pain in the neck and throat; enlarged lymph nodes in the neck; a dry cough, scratchy or scratchy feeling in the throat or behind the sternum.

There have also been claims that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer and other ailments.

Meanwhile, there have been suggestions that drugs to treat his cancer may have distorted his mind when he launched the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin insists that Putin is healthy.

Among the medics named as treating Putin were Dr Dmitry Verbovoy, an expert in acute illnesses, injuries and poisonings.

Another was Dr Konstantin Sim, an orthopaedic traumatologist, possibly helping with ice hockey injuries, ENT doctor Alexei Shcheglov and infectious disease specialist Yaroslav Protasenko.

He was also seen by neurosurgeons from the Central Clinical Hospital, led by department head Oleg Myshkin and Dr Elena Rastrusina, plus a resuscitator

Dr Pavel Sharikov, and head nurse Lyudmila Kadenkova.

A rehabilitation specialist was also involved, Dr Mikhail Tsykunov.In July 2020, Putin met with the head of the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Ivan Dedov.

It comes after the former head of MI6 suggested said there could be a coup inside the Kremlin to oust Putin - but the mechanisms for political change in Russia are ""fragile"".

Sir Richard Dearlove told The Sun: ""I think we're heading into another phase where you're going to get a political upheaval as a result of a war gone badly wrong.

 Russia will win the special operation in Ukraine if the society shows consolidation and composure to the enemy, President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant on March 14, Rossiya 24 TV channel said.

Russia is not improving its geopolitical position in Ukraine. Instead, Russia is fighting ""for the survival of Russian statehood, for the future development of the country and our children.""

""In order to bring peace and stability closer, we, of course, need to show the consolidation and composure of our society. When the enemy sees that our society is strong, internally braced up, consolidated, then, without any doubt we will come to reach what we are striving for — both success and victory,"" Putin said.

According to him, many of the current problems began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when they tried to put pressure on Russia to ""destabilise the internal political situation.” ""Hordes of international terrorists"" new sent to the purpose to accomplish this goal, Putin said.

Afterwards, the West decided to start rehabilitating Nazism in Russia's neighbouring states, including in Ukraine.

Nevertheless, Putin continued, Russia had long tried to build partnerships with both Western countries and Ukraine. However, after 2014, when the West contributed to the coup in Ukraine, the state of affairs changed dramatically. It was then when they started exterminating those who advocated the development of normal relations with Russia, he said.

According to Putin, Russia was forced to launch the special operation to protect the population. Western countries were hoping to break Russia quickly, but they were wrong, he said adding that Russia managed to raise its economic sovereignty since 2022.

Sergei Zhirnov claims to have served alongside the Russian tyrant in the KGB intelligence service of the former Soviet Union, which is now known as the FSB.

Zhirnov said he had believed until now that claims of Putin using doppelgangers were “conspiracy theories”.

But he has now changed his mind, citing a speech made by a “skinny” and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro-war concert next day in Moscow as evidence.

Footage highlights him waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose, not traits especially common with Putin.

Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that “a totally different Putin pops up” with “a wider face as if he bloated in 24 hours”.

Zhirnov is now exiled in France and was a former classmate of Putin at KGB Red Flag Institute, a spy training centre.

The claim Putin uses a body double has also been made by the head of Ukrainian military intelligence.

Major General Kyrylo Budanov claimed the body doubles are used to hide Putin’s loss of control in the Kremlin.

He claimed Ukrainian secret services detected Putin body doubles standing in for him on a number of ""special occasions"" in the past, but this had become ""usual practice"" now

""We know specifically about three people that keep appearing, but how many there are, we don't know,"" Budanov said.

""They all had plastic surgery to look alike.""

The spy chief alleged all the doubles had surgery but said the one thing that gives them away is their height.

“It's visible in videos and pictures. Also gesturing, body language and earlobes, since they are unique for every person.""

The claim that Putin uses body doubles is also regularly made by the General SVR Telegram and YouTube channel, which claims to be run by a Kremlin insider.

Most experts dismiss such claims as absurd and far-fetched, though several noticed Putin’s unusually buoyant mood in Siberia, compared to recent public appearances in Moscow.

One claim was that Putin had had an extra dose of medicine.

It has been alleged body doubles were used by former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.

Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles, but he claimed the idea was rejected.

""I discarded the idea of any doubles,” he said.

He admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks.

It was suggested a lookalike should take his place at events where the head of state might be at risk, he said.

Back in 1959 Vice President Richard Nixon visited Moscow and held his famous “Kitchen debate” with Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. Nixon favorably compared the standard of living of American suburbanites to that of their Russian counterparts under Communism.

Criticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.

But late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.

The charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.

Yet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”

Indeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.

But issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.

As an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:

- Russia, China, Iran…and Saudi Arabia?

Over the last few months, America and its Western allies have declared their unilateral right to set a cap on the price Russia charges for its oil, seeking to use their dominance over the international financial infrastructure to reduce Russian revenue on its sale of natural resources to other countries.

Russia and Saudi Arabia are two of the world’s leading oil exporters, and with the latter nation now having dramatically shifted towards the Russia-China alliance, its leadership recently declared that they would ban sales to any country that sought to impose a price cap on its oil."

 by Kurt Nimmo, Kurt Nimmo on Geopolitics:

In the “collective West,” hypocrisy rules the narrative, most recently in regard to the ICC and the “kidnapped” children of Ukraine.

In America, the scurrilous neocon and warmonger propagandist Max Boot weighed in on the meaningless and unenforcible decision to arrest President Putin. Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Propaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.

The hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.

The Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.

The “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).

In 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.

“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”

A statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”

The operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.

Uncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.

Naturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.

 Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war

To the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.

While many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.

Nevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them. If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?

At this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.

If the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?

Denys Arcuri, Indio

..

To the editor: Letter writers advocating escalating use of force by the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine illustrate how Euro-centric and frankly white-centric our global views are.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?

Like the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.

Few Americans advocated for a global power to intercede and put an end to their suffering.

 Beijing: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has called for the BRICS nations to give up US dollar and come up with their own alternative currency to settle cross-border trade.

During his first state visit to China since taking office in January, Lula also lashed out the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and criticised the outsize role of the greenback in global trade.

His comments came mere days after the Brazilian government ditched dollar as an intermediary and announced a deal to trade in local currency with China.

Lula voices for de-dollarization

Lending his voice to China’s efforts to shed the dollar’s dominance and promote the use of the renminbi (RMB)/ yuan in overseas trade settlement, the Brazilian President said: “Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard?”

“Why can’t we do trade based on our own currencies?” he said during his address at the New Development Bank in Shanghai, known as the “BRICS bank”.

“Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar,” Lula added.

It is being said that at the BRICS annual summit in South Africa, the member countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – will create a new currency to facilitate overseas trade. The final agreement could come up as early as in August this year.

Also Read: Dumping the Dollar: Will a new BRICS currency replace the US currency for trade?

As per reports, Russia is behind the idea of the alternative currency as it continues to face economic sanctions from the West over its invasion of Ukraine.

Don’t chase dollars

“Why can’t a bank like the BRICS bank have a currency to finance trade between Brazil and China, between Brazil and other BRICS countries?… Today, countries have to chase after dollars to export, when they could be exporting in their own currencies,"" Lula said.

Hitting out at the IMF, Lula alluded to accusations the global lenders’ overly harsh spending cuts on cash-strapped countries like Brazil’s neighbour Argentina in exchange for bailout loans.

“No bank should be asphyxiating countries’ economies the way the IMF is doing now with Argentina, or the way they did with Brazil for a long time and every third-world country,"" he said.

“No leader can work with a knife to their throat because (their country) owes money,"" he added.

Brazil-China trade

Trade between Brazil and China soared over the past decade to $150.4 billion in 2022.

China imports agricultural commodities and minerals from Brazil apart from investing in the Latin American country’s consumer market and infrastructure sector.

Earlier this week, the Brazilian branch of the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China settled its first overseas transaction directly in RMB in the country. With the increase in bilateral trade and growing economic relationship, both countries have now been using their respective currencies to settle payments.

Can yuan be the new dollar?

The Chinese yuan’s role in trade finance has more than doubled since the Ukraine war, but at present, it is a poor contender to replace the US dollar as the global currency.

Not only is it virtually pegged to the dollar, China’s tight control of its currency keeps it from adhering to free market flows.

 A top Russian military spy has been bombarded with sex toys after his personal email was hacked.

Ukrainian hackers claim they gained access to Sergey Morgachev's AliExpress account, ordering multiple sex toys and gay pride flags in his name.

The embarrassing hack was intended as ""a symbolic act of moral humiliation.""

Morgachev is Vladimir Putin's Lieutenant Colonel at Moscow's chief intelligence office, the GRU.

It is believed he was in charge of Russia's notorious ""Fancy Bear"" hackers, also known as APT28.

The hackers, who call themselves Cyber Resistance, claimed on Telegram that they had managed to break into Morgachev's email account.

Then, they were able to access personal information such as family photos and scanned documents of people associated with him, according to the open-source intelligence site Info Nampalm.

Referring to Morgachev in a message after the theft, the group said ""a very cool and clever hacker, but... We hacked him"".

The hack is considered to appear ""pretty credible"" by Ukrainian hacking expert Stefan Soesanto, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.

Info Nampalm reported that the hack confirmed Morgachev's identity by sifting through stolen personnel files.

Among these was a document that showed him to be a department head in Unit 26165.

The Russian hacker was accused by the FBI of holding the same position in 2018.

He is on the FBI's wanted list for his part in hacking senior US Democrats including Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016.

It is said Morgachev and the GRU ""knowingly and intentionally conspired… to gain unauthorised access into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election,"" according to a federal indictment filed by the Department of Justice.

In the document, he is described by the FBI as an officer in Russia's military spy agency, in a department ""dedicated to developing and managing malware.""

This was said to include the ""X-Agent"" spy software used to hack the DNC.

Microsoft later revealed in 2020 that the US election was targeted by the Russian group who launched attacks on people in both the Trump and the Biden campaign."

 Putin’s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds

RUSSIAN prisoners who have tested positive for HIV are choosing to be sent to the frontline hoping to get lifesaving medication.

A large number of Vladimir Putin's HIV-positive prisoner recruits deemed they preferred the battlefield rather than rot in jail where they were denied treatment.

The Wagner Group has been mass-recruiting inmates from Russia's infamous prisons, offering them a pardon if they survive for six months.

Ukrainian officials estimate about 20 per cent of recruits in Russian prisoner units are HIV positive.

And a lot of them were so desperate for the anti-viral medications they couldn't get in jail, they opted to join Putin's bloody war in Ukraine, the New York Times reported.

Speaking from a detention centre in Dnipro, an HIV-positive Russian soldier named Timur, 37, told the newspaper: ""Conditions were very harsh.""

He said how doctors in prison changed the anti-viral medication to a different type that he suspected was not effective.

Fearing he was not going to last his ten-year sentence behind bars, agreed to join Putin's bloodthirsty Wagner Group for six months in exchange for a pardon and supplies of anti-viral medications.

Speaking about the dilemma of poor treatment in prison or fight in Ukraine, he said: ""I understood I would have a quick death or a slow death. I chose a quick death.""

Timur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.

He said that the unit's commanders ""repeated many times, ‘if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.’""

While he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.

Another soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.

He said: ""If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.""

New conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these ""sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands"".

""In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,"" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.

The report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside ""infected"" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.

Another HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.

He said: ""There were no conditions for the HIV infected.

""We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.""

It is estimated a total of 50,000 prisoners have signed up to fight in Ukraine, roughly 10 per cent of the incarcerated population.

 by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:

No one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.

Which is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.

Someone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.

If Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.

But, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.

Not only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.

But even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.

Instead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.

When the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”

No one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.

Isolated and friendless

It might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself."

 Ukraine’s Western allies are concerned that the military support for Kyiv may soon peak, as the US enters a divisive presidential, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing unnamed Western officials.

“Ukraine’s allies fear military support for its battle against Russia is nearing a peak, with senior European officials increasingly concerned about the flow of aid next year as the US enters a divisive presidential campaign,” the Financial Times reported.

According to the FT, Washington has been Kyiv’s major source of military aid. US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground.

“We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more.

Politico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer.

European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported.

Recently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war.

Zelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K.

The war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.

 The Wagner mercenary group’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin has announced that he will withdraw his troops from Bakhmut by next month and transfer control to the Russian army. The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.

The claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.

“Wagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.

Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.

Before planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.

He said, “If the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.”

Prigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow’s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.

Wagner fighters have spearheaded Russia’s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s influence has risen hugely during Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.

The Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

The Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin said that his troops had finally pushed the Ukrainians out of the last built-up area inside the city.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement, “As a result of offensive actions by Wagner assault units, supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces, the liberation of Artyomovsk has been completed.”

“Vladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk (the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut),” TASS agency quoted the Kremlin saying.

 DRAMATIC video shows a tank storming across the border from Ukraine into Russia today as anti-Putin soldiers claimed to have seized villages.

Drones were also reportedly used in the ""invasion"" as explosions rang out along the frontier in the Belgorod region - where the local governor issued a desperate ""don't panic"" message to residents.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, told residents that to ensure safety of citizens in the region, a ""counter-terrorist regime"" has been introduced.

Russian authorities said a ""Ukrainian Army sabotage group"" crossed the border and forces were ""taking measures to eliminate the enemy"".

Ukrainian intelligence said those involved in the incursion were ""solely Russian nationals"".

The provocative move was claimed by the Freedom of Russia Legion, a unit made up of ethnic Russian volunteers and defectors from the Russian army to fight alongside Ukraine.

In an unverified video today, members of the anti-Putin group posed in front of a road sign and an armoured car.

They claimed: ""We have again crossed the border of the Russian Federation. Russia will soon be free.

""The time to fight for the freedom of Russia has come.

""We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people... but that has no place in today's Putin's Russia.""

Armoured vehicles with Ukrainian markings were also spotted near the border, further fuelling rumours of an invasion by pro-Ukraine Russian saboteurs.

Smoke was spotted in multiple locations near border checkpoints in the region, along with videos online appearing to show a Russian soldier dead inside a checkpoint building.

And a helicopter was reportedly seen flying low over houses and deploying anti-missile flares in Rakitnoye, some 30 miles from the Grayvoron border crossing where the tank was spotted.

One post showed a radio message urgently telling Belgorod citizens to evacuate the area.

Governor Gladkov told residents earlier today: ""No one is hurt, the evacuation from Shebensky district is a lie.

""I urge you not to listen to enemies and not to panic.""

In a post on Telegram, the Freedom of Russia Legion shared a photo of a ""free Russia"" flag on a bridge.

They said: ""The first flags of free Russia met the dawn over the liberated cities. Raise the flags in your cities too. Freedom is near!""

The group claimed they had taken control of Kozinka and Gora-Podol villages.

Rumours spread that up to six other villages came under drone and mortar fire.

The flag raised in the photo is the flag used by Russian anti-war protesters - many of whom live in eastern Ukraine - and is also displayed on the Freedom of Russia Legion's Telegram channel.

It describes them as ""free citizens of Russia"" who are fighting against the ""dictatorial regime"" in Russia.

Another video widely shared online appeared to show the soldiers running into the streets of the southern Belgorod region.

This was followed by aerial shots of border towns showing smoke billowing from multiple buildings.

Russian authorities said administrative building in the town of Golovchino was allegedly struck by a drone, and part of a rocket fell into the garden of a home in the village of Antonovka.

Authorities claimed to have full control of the villages and said they were hunting the ""terrorists"" involved in the incursion.

 Putin’s unwillingness to use sufficient force to end a conflict that should not have lasted one week is leading to much wider war.

NATO at the summit in Vilnius is likely to approve plans to increase the number of troops in a state of high alert to 300,000, as well as other changes in the military structure, said Secretary General Stoltenberg.

Plans to increase the number of its rapid reaction forces to more than 300 thousand. people from 40,000. Stoltenberg said in June 2022. He noted that this will take place within the framework of the implementation of new regional plans.

In May, Stoltenberg said that these plans would be described as a bloc to deter and protect NATO allies from any aggression: they contain precise demands for the transformation of the armed forces, including their deployment. The Secretary General also announced more Allied exercises, bringing more forces into combat readiness, strengthening the command structure and control in the alliance.

As reported in March, the increase in the number of the military may imply the emergence of two echelons. The first will be 100,000. soldiers ready to be sent within ten days. The second echelon is reinforcements, that is, the military sent for support, they will have to be ready for the transfer within 10-30 days.

The Spanish El Pais reported in May that the bloc was finalizing a common strategy to counter the threat from Russia and terrorism. This strategy, according to sources of the publication, is changing NATO’s approaches to deploying forces in different regions and responding to threats from Moscow.

 The Biden administration has no plans to replenish the stockpile of controversial cluster bombs it’s sending to Ukraine, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

“Our current plan is not to replenish that stockpile,” Sullivan told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” .

“It is rather to build up the capacity to produce the unitary round of the 155, the non-cluster munition round of ammunition,” he said.

Earlier this month, President Biden opted to send the divisive ammunition to Ukraine — and publicly acknowledged he was prompted to do so because the military is running low on 155 mm artillery ammunition rounds.

A chorus of critics — both abroad and at home — decried the decision, citing the grave dangers cluster munitions pose to civilians given their dud rates.

Sullivan echoed Biden’s defense — that the US must supply Ukraine with adequate firepower.

“We began that process months ago was we anticipated the need for continuing supply Ukraine, but it takes time and that is why we need a bridge from today,” he said, referencing steps to boost production of 155 mm rounds.

“We need to ensure that Ukraine has the necessary supply of ammunition to a few months down the road, when we believe we can supply enough of the unitary round to meet Ukraine’s defense needs.”

Cluster bombs are prohibited by over 100 countries across the world, including multiple NATO members.

Military officials claim the cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine have a dud rate of around 2.35% or less — markedly lower than the roughly 30% and 40% dud rate estimated for Russia’s cluster munitions being deployed against Ukraine.

The dud rate refers to the likelihood of the bomblets in the cluster munitions not exploding after being deployed.

Bomblets that are duds may detonate long after being deployed.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin previously committed to having the US help Ukraine scour and clean up duds from those munitions.

Sullivan insisted dissemination of the controversial bombs doesn’t undercut US’ “moral authority.”

“Our moral authority and Ukraine’s moral authority in this conflict comes from the fact that we are supporting a country under brutal, vicious attack by its neighbor with missiles and bombs raining down in its cities, killing its civilians, destroying its schools, it’s churches, its hospitals,” he said.

“The idea that providing Ukraine with a weapon in order for them to be able to defend their homeland, protect their civilians is somehow a challenge for moral authority I find questionable,” he added.

Last week, NATO held a summit in Vilinius, lithuania, and ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit there, he slammed NATO allies for their position on admitting the war-torn nation into the powerful alliance.

Sullivan reiterated the US position that Ukraine can receive admittance once it wraps up the necessary reforms to meet the alliance’s democracy requirements.

“We could have said it more clearly,” Sullivan said, alluding to a NATO communique. “Ukraine’s future will be in NATO. Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence. It’s not subject to negotiation from any country, including Russia."

 Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back on social media after an out-of-context video clip of him suggesting he’s more interested in the war in Ukraine than issues plaguing cities across the US went viral on Friday.

In the video, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson questions the 2024 Republican presidential candidate about where his priorities lie after Pence criticizes the length of time it has taken the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion of the former Soviet state.

“You are distressed that the Ukrainians don’t have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.

To which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”

Several conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”

The former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.

“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.

In the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.

“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.”

Pence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.

“I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn’t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,” Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June."

 By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

he rouble slumped to 100 against the dollar on Monday, hitting three figures for the first time in almost 17 months, struggling under the weight of strong foreign exchange demand and Russia's shrinking balance of trade.

By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

It lost 1.5 percent to trade at 110.44 versus the euro, also a near 17-month low, and shed 1.3 percent against the yuan to 13.87.

The rouble has chartered a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenues.

Russia's central bank has blamed the rouble's weakening on falling export revenues and recovering imports, but a Kremlin aide on Monday said loose monetary policy was to blame, a sign of discord among Russia's monetary authorities.

Brent crude oil LCOc1, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.9% at $86.05 a barrel, not far from a more than seven-month high hit last week.

The rouble, already under pressure amid robust demand for foreign currency and limited supply from exporting firms, has failed to benefit from strong oil prices.

A trader at a large Russian bank told Reuters the market was confused: ""Everyone is ready for the inflow of revenues from expensive oil, but it seems to be hanging somewhere, and our regulators are somehow indifferent, there is nothing to rely on.""

Russian stock indexes were higher.

""The unstoppable and puzzling growth of the USD/RUB rate...continues to support retail investors' interest in equities as a way to save their depreciating rouble savings,"" said Sinara Investment Bank in a note.

The dollar-denominated RTS index .IRTS was up 0.2 percent to 1,002.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 1.6 percent higher at 3,205.4 points, at a pre-invasion high.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping for talks in Beijing in October, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, Putin’s first known trip abroad since an arrest warrant was issued against him over the deportation of children from Ukraine.

Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally and the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said Russia and China should deepen cooperation in the face of the West’s attempt to contain them both.

He was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that the talks in Beijing would be “thorough”, at a meeting in Moscow with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi.

Putin will attend the third Belt and Road Forum after an invitation by Xi during a high-profile visit to Moscow in March.

Days before that visit, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on suspicion of illegally deporting hundreds of children or more from Ukraine.

Moscow denies the allegations and the Kremlin said the warrant was evidence of the West’s hostility to Russia, which opened a criminal case against the ICC prosecutor and the judges who issued the warrant.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine early last year has triggered one of the deadliest European conflicts since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Putin has pivoted towards China, and Xi has stood by him.

Chinese-Russian trade has soared since the invasion, and Russia has sold Asian powers including China greater volumes of the oil it can no longer sell to the West because of sanctions.

Putin last visited Beijing in February 2022, days before the invasion, where he and Xi announced a ‘no limits’ partnership. Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.

The United States sees China as its gravest long-term “strategic competitor” and Russia as an “acute threat”.

China has refrained from condemning Russia’s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a “special military operation”.

Earlier this year, CIA Director William Burns said Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China and was even at risk of becoming its “economic colony” in time."

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who visited European countries last week, wanted to make a solidarity visit to Israel alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but was turned down by Israel.

More stories:

According to sources familiar with the request, Israel informed the Jewish leader that ""it's not the right time"", but he might visit later. Zelensky wishes to express support for Israel, but due to his own constraints - as Ukraine has been under attack from Russia for nearly two years - he cannot make it to Israel on a ""standalone trip"" and is expected to include Israel as part of a future European tour.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian police, spanning its many units including the special forces, crafted a heartfelt tribute to the State of Israel through a video featuring officers from across their ranks.

""The year is 2023. Israel was brutally attacked by terrorists. During the attack, hundreds of civilians, military personnel, including police officers were killed,” members of the Patrol Police of Ukraine say in the video.

“Patrol officers express their deepest respect and gratitude to police and military officers of Israel. To those who were the first to join the battle and became the adamant defenders of their citizens.

“We are deeply saddened by the deaths and losses that Israel has suffered as a result of this brutal aggression. The Patrol Police of Ukraine stands side by side with Israel at this important moment. And we express our most sincere solidarity to all police and military families of Israel. May our mutual friendship and support help Israel to overcome these turbulent times and return to peace and security.”

Blogger Ilya Sokolov said that he has been receiving numerous inquiries from non-Jewish friends in Ukraine who are interested in going to Israel to fight Hamas. ""The solidarity with Israel is overwhelming,"" he said."

 CIA's Burns & SecDef Austin In Separate 'Urgent' Trips To Ukraine As War Effort Implodes

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.

""I was honored to meet with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine,"" Austin wrote on X. ""We, along with our allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine’s urgent battlefield needs and long-term defense requirements,"" Austin added.

This convenient shift of Washington and the Pentagon to talking mainly about ""long-term defense"" began occurring as it became clear Ukraine's counteroffensive was failing.

But Congress has been dragging its feet on passing Biden's latest supplemental funding requests - again given there's been some wrangling over what gets sent to Israel vs. what's set aside for Ukraine.

This is Austin's second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. ""I’m here today to deliver an important message – the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia’s aggression, both now and into the future,"" he said.

Just last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials. Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:

Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?

The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.

Indeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?

""The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,"" the Asia Times report continued. ""The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.""

Zelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well."

 Fetterman drapes himself in Israeli flag during DC rally in support of the Jewish state

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) draped himself in an Israel flag as he joined the nearly 300,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC, Tuesday in support of the Jewish state as it wages war against Hamas terrorists.

The Pennsylvania Democrat was photographed at the March for Israel rally with the blue and white flag wrapped over his trademark hoodie as he greeted attendees.

Fetterman has been unequivocal in his staunch support of Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack despite facing some left-wing backlash over his stance.

“Of course I’m here, how could I not!” Fetterman told one rally-goer, according to an attendee’s X post.

A sharp-eyed X user pointed out that Fetterman used the strings on his hoodie to affix the flag to himself in “the most bipartisan act I’ve ever seen from a Senator.”

Fetterman’s fondness for the Israeli flag triggered several pro-Palestinian protesters outside the US Capitol last week, after the senator emerged from the building waving a small Star of David flag above his head as some demonstrators were being arrested.

“Shame! What a joke!” some of the booing protesters shouted as Fetterman strolled by.

In his office, the senator also displays the posters of the innocent Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their deadly raid which also killed 1,200 people.

“They will stay up until every single person is safely returned home,” Fetterman noted in a video posted on X.

Fetterman has also argued against a cease-fire in the conflict, which has reportedly angered some of his supporters and former staffers.

“Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children,” the former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania said in anOct. 18 post on X. “Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.”

Fetterman, however, has remained a harsh critic of congressional Republican efforts to decouple US military aid for Israel from a separate aid proposal for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

On Tuesday he called on his GOP colleagues in the upper chamber to cease efforts to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill.

“Israel and Ukraine are going through existential threats. We need to send aid to BOTH, and my Republican colleagues need to cut the crap,” Fetterman wrote on X.

“This isn’t a game,” he added."

 Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits

In surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.

""A turning point in the war is approaching,"" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. ""The next year will be decisive in this regard."" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.

Yermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has ""a clear plan"" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.

He described advancing plans for ""the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.""

But he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more ""weapons right now""--describing that ""Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.""

Without doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as ""the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.""

So now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the ""bad news"" of late out of Ukraine.

Yermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be ""charity"" but is instead an ""investment"" in America's ""global leadership.""

He further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. ""We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,"" Yermak said.

outheast Asian defence ministers meet in Indonesia alongside key players in the Indo-Pacific this week, with the ASEAN bloc set to reinforce a message of centrality as major powers jostle for influence in the region.

The annual get-together, which starts on Wednesday, comes as conflict rages in the Middle East and Ukraine and as tensions ratchet up in disputed waters in the South China Sea, where China is being accused of aggression against the Philippines, which has US backing and seeks to boost its military ties with Japan.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) chair Indonesia has yet to confirm attendees, but among them is US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will meet ASEAN counterparts on Wednesday.

The talks will expand on Thursday to include Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Australia.

ASEAN, a region of about 660 million people with a combined gross domestic product of more than $3.2 trillion, has for years been courted by Washington and Beijing, but their fierce rivalry has caused its members concern.

""Competition is good. But competition should not deteriorate into a zero-sum game,"" Defence Minister and presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto told a foreign policy forum this week, where he stressed the importance of non-alignment.

Relations between China and the United States have been frosty after President Joe Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

It was unclear who will represent China at the Jakarta meeting after the removal of its defence minister in October, raising questions about the stability of the leadership around President Xi Jinping.

Austin comes to Indonesia from South Korea, where he reiterated concerns about Russia and China helping North Korea to evade sanctions and Moscow's closer military ties with Pyongyang.

Washington has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, and Moscow of providing technical military support to help the North.

Aaron Connelly, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, said conflict in Gaza and Ukraine and China's moves to block Philippine resupply missions at a disputed reef will most likely feature at the meeting.

""This forum is not one where major geopolitical developments are really addressed or moved forward in any significant way. But we do expect discussions from the US and Philippines on topics like the Second Thomas Shoal, Israel-Hamas, Ukraine,"" Connelly said.

 Recommended articles

The Minister of Education, Prof Tahir Mamman said this at the 2023/2024 Pre-departure briefing of Bilateral Education Agreement Scholars to Russia in Abuja on Tuesday. The first batch of students are already on their way to the airport for departure, while the second and third batches would depart on November 15 and November 17 respectively.

Represented by the Director of Universities Education in the ministry, Rakiya Ilyasu, Mamman advised the scholars not to see the opportunity as uncontrolled freedom to do things that would be to their disgrace.

He explained that the country had invested a lot in them and as such required the returns of investment on their return to the country.

“Note that you are few out of thousands who secured this opportunity which you must not take for granted. Your parents and teachers would also be happy with your succor.

“Your selection is part of a broader plan which ensures that brilliant Nigerians, especially those that cannot afford to study programmes that are not readily available in Nigeria, are supported to get necessary knowledge, skills and competence that would be useful in Nigeria’s development agenda.

“I am happy to inform you that in spite of the global economic meltdown, the number of our development partners have increased and many of them now offer scholarship to Nigeria.

“As you prepare to travel out, ensure to uphold and eschew good values, focus on your studies and be a good ambassador of your country,” he said.

The Minister also charged the scholars to always strive to abide by the laws of their host country and as well remember to be their brother’s keeper in their new environment.

“Most importantly, you need to make your presence known to the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow. This is very necessary based on our experiences from Ukraine.

“Your parents are also spending a lot of resources on you. Note that we all expert you return to our dear country at the end of your studies to assist Nigeria to become a better place by contributing your quota to its development, using your new knowledge and skills,” he added.

Also speaking, the Director, Federal Scholarship Board, Asta Ndajiwo said the journey began in November 2022 with applications from thousands of Nigerians which later translated to the nomination of the candidates. Ndajiwo commended the Federal Government efforts especially in the payment of the scholars allowances from September to December.

She also advised the scholars to do away with any extracurricular activities that could take their lives, recalling an incident with previous two scholars who lost their lives while swimming in a pool.

“We regret loosing two Nigerians scholars in Russia in the past that went to swim and in the process got drowned. We don’t want to loose anyone again and so we advise you stay away from water if you cannot swim.

“We want you to be your brother’s keeper, work hard and face your studies as you also be a good ambassador of the country."

 If Finland decides to allow a “concentration” of troops on its border with Russia, it would be viewed by Moscow as a threat, the Kremlin said, after Poland offered to send military advisers to help Helsinki monitor the frontier.

The head of the Polish National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said in a post on social media X that Poland would send military advisers to its NATO ally Finland, in response to “an official request for allied support in the face of a hybrid attack on the Finnish border”.

“A team of military advisers will provide on-site knowledge on border security, also in operational terms,” he said.

Finland said on Thursday it was unaware of the Polish offer. It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.

Asked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”

“The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.”

Any planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.

Finland’s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland’s eastern border.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto’s office said in a statement to Reuters.

Finland infuriated Russia earlier this year when it joined NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment, due to the war in Ukraine."

 by Rhoda Wilson, Expose News:

The Pentagon’s recent developments in AI technology have drawn concern and criticism as they approach the deployment of autonomous AI weapons systems capable of making lethal decisions independently.

The New York Times reports that countries such as the United States, China and Israel are actively working on lethal autonomous weapons empowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), which can autonomously identify and engage targets.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Critics argue that the use of AI-controlled drones with the ability to autonomously kill humans is a highly alarming development, as it places life-or-death choices on machines with minimal human oversight. Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.

The issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.

US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.

Critics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.

Advocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond. The campaign notes the urgent need for a global treaty banning autonomous weapons to prevent the wide-scale production and proliferation of these technologies from potentially falling into the wrong hands."

""Russia does not feel threatened"": Estonian Prime Minister calls for long-range missiles to be transferred to Ukraine

Western countries should provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with all the weapons they need to liberate all the territories seized by Russia. First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.

This was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.

The head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.

Kallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are ""much larger"" than Russia's budget.

""Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,"" said the Estonian prime minister.

The absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.

""If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,"" the official said.

She also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.

Speaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.

As OBOZ.UA previously reported, the head of state called on the West to strengthen support for Ukraine. He emphasized that the Armed Forces of Ukraine need more shells, and they will move forward.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that if the United Kingdom signs an imminent deal with Ukraine to put troops in the country, Moscow would consider it as a declaration of war. Medvedev was reacting to the imminent signing of a security agreement between London and Kiev.

Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, issued his warning in a social media post.

A visit to Kiev on Friday by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is set to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, would ensure British troops would be openly deployed to Ukraine.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Sunak’s arrival in the Ukrainian capital is meant to “set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership,” his office said in a statement. The security document is a follow-up to agreements reached by G7 and NATO members last year, it noted. The statement did not mention any plans for a British military deployment in Ukraine, however, it could be implied.

“[The deal] formalizes a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” Downing Street said, according to a report by RT.

The British government has pledged £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in military aid to Ukraine over the next two years, including in the form of thousands of military drones, which London said will be the largest of their kind ever received by Kiev. Most of the UAVs will be made in the UK, the announcement added. –RT

 Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said Britain is in a “pre-war world” and cannot afford to reduce spending on the military.

In a major speech at Lancaster House in London, Mr. Shapps said the “peace dividend” that followed the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s was over.

Mr. Shapps said: “Because the era of the peace dividend is over, in five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.”

“Ask yourself, looking at today’s conflicts across the world, is it more likely that that number grows or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer. It’s likely to grow,” he added.

Mr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO’s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a £2.5 billion support package to Ukraine.

Over the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.

The British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.

His speech on Monday—in front of an audience including top brass in the British military—might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.

Mr. Shapps said, “We made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we’ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.”

“But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,” he added.

‘The Tanks Are Literally on Europe’s Ukrainian Lawn’The defence secretary said: “An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.”

“The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,” he added.

Mr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.

He said the strike against the Houthis was a “single action” but added, “We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.”

Later Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would “not hesitate” to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.

Mr. Sunak told Sky News, “As we’ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.”

“Freedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,” he said.

He added, “They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.”"

 ""Aren't They Fools?"": Putin Says Ukrainian Statehood Risks 'Irreparable Blow' If War Continues

Russian President Vladimir Putin gave statements on Tuesday which assessed the overall status of the nearly two-year conflict with Ukraine at a moment Western and world leaders meet in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.

But Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an ""irreparable"" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already ""failed"".

""Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Putin said in the televised remarks. ""If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,"" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.

""They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,"" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.

Putin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.

""The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,"" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.

""As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,"" the Russian leader continued.

He explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...

""A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'"" Putin said.

He stressed: ""Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.""

Lately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, ""China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia."" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict. Kiev hopes to get Global South countries on its side, thus further isolating Moscow - but so far this has proved somewhat futile."

 by Tom Luongo, Tom Luongo:

“The Vorlons say, understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth”

— John Sheridan, Babylon 5

The biggest media story of 2024 so far has come and gone. Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.

Everyone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Now, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.

So, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.

I’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.

How many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?

If he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.

I thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t

— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024

This was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.

But this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.

By contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.

What’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.

This way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.

Then to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.

We were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.

So, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.

I know… in other news water is wet and women want more sex when they’re fertile."

 Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

ussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he was grateful to controversial right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson for his interview last week and ""intermediary"" role with the West.

Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

In it, the Russian president said the West needed to understand that it was ""impossible"" for Russia to be defeated in Ukraine.

""Since we are not able to have direct dialogue (with the West) today... we have to be grateful to Mr Carlson to be able to do it by his intermediary"" role, Putin told journalists in quotes distributed by the Kremlin.

Even so, Putin said he was ""not totally satisfied"" with the interview, the first he has given to a Western journalist since launching his offensive in Ukraine.

It has been seen more than 200 million times on X, formerly Twitter.

Putin's disappointment, though, seemed to stem from his hopes for a more bellicose exchange, saying that he expected Carlson to be more ""aggressive"" and was waiting for ""difficult questions"".

""I was not only ready for that but I was hoping for it because that would have allowed me to reply in the same manner,"" Putin said.

Carlson came in for criticism from Western media for the lack of tough questions in the interview, in which Putin lectured him on his views of Russian history, portraying the country as a victim of Western betrayals.

Putin acknowledged that Carlson had ""tried to interrupt me several times"" but praised the conservative journalist, who is close to former US president Donald Trump, for his ""patience"".

The Russian leader did complain, though, that his quotes were ""deformed"" in Western media.

 NATO Troops Are Operating In Ukraine Disguised As Mercenaries, Russian General Claims

By Magyar Nemzet of Remix News

A Russian general is claiming that NATO troops are in Ukraine, but they are being disguised as mercenaries to justify their presence, with a number of American and Polish bodies found in Avdiivka, the city recently captured by Russian forces over the last few days.

In an interview with Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, General Sergei Rudskoy, chief operations director of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said that NATO military personnel are taking part in the fighting in Ukraine disguised as mercenaries.

“NATO soldiers are taking part in the fighting disguised as mercenaries. They control air defense systems for operational and tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers, and are part of assault teams,” Rudskoy said. According to him, NATO officers directly shape the military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the bodies of soldiers with Polish and American insignia on their clothes had been found in the Russian-controlled Avdiivka.

“The clearing of Avdiivka has revealed quite a few interesting details. In this case, bodies abandoned by Ukrainian armed units with American and Polish insignia sewn on their uniforms,” Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the “Donetsk People’s Republic,” told Russia’s TASS/TRANS news agency.

This information cannot be independently verified.

Gen. Rudskoy claims that Ukraine is being used as a proxy against Russia.

“Western countries make no secret of their desire to inflict a strategic defeat on our country. In order to achieve this goal, Washington and Brussels have chosen Ukraine, where anti-Russian, nationalist sentiment has been nurtured since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At present, the Ukrainian people are being used by the United States as cannon fodder for its geopolitical ambitions of world domination. Therefore, the threats to our country today are no less serious than in the years of 1941-1945 last century,” said Gen. Rudskoy.

With the fall of Avdiivka, Ukraine has lost one of the most important cities on the Donetsk frontline, Many believe that the town is now serving as a second Bakhmut, as it was clear months ago that it could only be held temporarily at the cost of tens of thousands of soldiers’ lives.

 by Leo Hohmann, Leo Hohmann:

Using duplicity, deception and secret alliances, the U.K.’s inner circle of top elites led by Nathaniel Rothschild, King Edward VII, and Lord Alfred Milner backed the German Kaiser into a corner and intentionally set the Germans up to blame them for starting the First World War, when in fact it was the British who provoked the Germans to the point where war was the only option.

German generals were caught strategizing several weeks ago on how to bomb Russia’s main bridge to Crimea. This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

And that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.

A March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.

“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.

Yes, a military draft.

A video produced by Remix News details testimony provided by Eva Högl, German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, who provided catastrophic details about the state of the German military. It is shocking in terms of its candor regarding the current state of the German armed forces.

She finds it “really impressive” that Germany has emptied out its military defense stocks by handing it over to Ukraine to be wasted in a losing war with Russia. That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.

But wait. There’s more.

Germany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.

An organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.

The stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.

According to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)"

 Molotov Cocktail Attack On Russian Embassy In Moldova On Last Day Of Election

Sunday is the final day of three days of presidential elections in Russia. Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed ""noon against Putin"".

While some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.

""A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,"" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.

There were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. ""He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,"" authorities said.

Moldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.

Reuters noted days ago that ""A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.""

""Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,"" the report continued. ""The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.""

The United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.

Last summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country ""over numerous unfriendly actions"" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue. As for Russia's election, Kremlin authorities have said Ukraine is engaged in cross-border attacks on polling stations and in annexed regions of Ukraine."

 RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s forces face shortages of munitions.

The Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.

The “United States will not let Ukraine fail”, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.

“We remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin’s aggression,” he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.

“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.

Top US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.

But he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”

Austin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”

“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”

The sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.

Speaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022."

 The United States knew in advance about the attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, the largest act of industrial terrorism in history, but did not step in to prevent them, according to an interview with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski published today.

In September 2022, Sikorski, then a member of the European Parliament (MEP), insinuated that Washington was complicit in the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline.

Sikorski tweeted a photo from the scene of the crime and signed it “Thank you, USA.” The MEP also pointed out Joe Biden’s standing threat to demolish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. However, his tweet was deleted just a few hours later.

Speaking with Polish news outlet Rzeczpospolita as the Polish foreign minister his week, Sikorski said “If we believe media, it [the attack] was carried out by someone who was interested in it. And the US had preliminary information about this and did not interfere with this move.”

However, Sikorski chose not name those responsible for the crime.

Almayadeen reports: US investigative journalist and Pulitzer award winner Seymour Hersh said on February 8 2023 that US Navy divers planted explosives to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022.

“Last June, the Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning,” Hersh wrote in his Substack newsletter.

The White House responded and dismissed the claims as “false and complete fiction.”

Flightradar24 data showed in late September 2022 that US military helicopters habitually and on numerous occasions circled for hours over the site of the Nord Stream pipeline incident near Bornholm Island.

RT reports: In an interview on Monday, Zelensky referred to comments made at the weekend by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The US politician told Fox News that he planned to move forward with a vote on an aid bill for Israel this week, without specifying when a Ukraine package would be taken up, or whether it would be tied to funding for West Jerusalem.

“This is pure politics, and it’s a disgrace for the world and a disgrace for democracy,” Zelensky told PBS NewsHour. “Nobody cares how many people are dying in Ukraine every day. They only care about their approval ratings,” he added

Johnson has since promised to advance the long-stalled Ukraine aid bill sought by President Joe Biden this week, multiple news outlets reported on Monday. Johnson reportedly told Republican colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he intends to allow the House to vote on a standalone bill in the coming days that would ensure additional military aid for Kiev. The House will also be expected to vote on separate bills providing more assistance to Israel and Taiwan.

House Republicans have previously refused to back the foreign aid bill unveiled by Biden in October, which includes $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.

The legislation has been held up for months as the GOP tries to force the White House to crack down on the influx of illegal immigrants via the southern US border. Biden’s 2024 election rival, former President Donald Trump, previously urged Republicans to block the bill, arguing against unconditional aid for Ukraine.

The delay in approving more weapons for Ukraine has rattled Zelensky and other officials in Kiev, who are blaming mounting battlefield losses on shortages of foreign-supplied ammunition and air defenses.

In his interview with PBS, Zelensky reiterated that without the US support, Ukraine “will have no chance of winning” in its conflict with Russia.

Moscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly stated that no amount of foreign assistance will change the outcome of the fighting, and has accused the West of escalating the hostilities."

 Russia on Monday said that there is currently “no basis” to hold an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the US amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv.

“There is no basis whatsoever for an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the United States in the face of a total hybrid war being waged against our country … It will be possible to discuss these topics only after the US authorities renounce their openly hostile anti-Russian policy,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a video address to the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference.

Lavrov expressed that efforts to reduce the potential of a conflict between Russia and the US should be “comprehensive in nature” and based on removing NATO’s eastward expansion.

He further said the West is balancing on the “dangerous edge” of a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers, indicating that Moscow is especially concerned that the three nuclear powers in the West are among Ukraine’s main supporters.

“The US-led ‘collective West’ is cynically complementing the deliberate destruction of balanced and equal agreements that do not suit Washington with the promotion of apparently dishonest schemes that would create advantages for the United States,” Lavrov also said.

He argued that the West’s goal is to create a “unilateral military advantage for themselves by setting new limits for nuclear arsenals while formalizing the aggregate Western superiority in the sphere of non-nuclear capabilities,” adding that the US and its allies are enlarging their network of alliances “directed against third countries” to achieve military superiority.

Lavrov went on to say that Russia’s move to revoke the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year was a “logical response to the destructive moves by the US and other Western countries.”

“That said, we remain a full-fledged party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,” he said.

The Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of “tailoring” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.

“We are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility. This is the only way of reducing interstate conflicts and ensuring real progress in arms control,” he said."

American Interventionism Is Dangerous,

But Is It Worse than the Alternative?

I’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.

Like all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.

Suddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!

But something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.

Subsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.

Basically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.

I was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.

Now, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.

No wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?

In my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.

In the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.

If this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.

Ukraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.

If you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities. Only five minutes later, when Carter was about to be notified and we were minutes away from launching a counterstrike, the operations room called to say it was a faulty chip!!!

Yeah, own silver… it’s going higher.

 KHARKIV - Russia pounded over 30 villages and towns in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region after launching a ground offensive in the border region, forcing almost 6,000 to evacuate, the governor said on Monday. Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia “currently is achieving tactical success” after driving a wedge into Kyiv’s defences. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had “improved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower” around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.

“They are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,” Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. “The KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones. Everything,” he said.On Friday, Russia began an offensive across its border into the Kharkiv region and later claimed to have taken several villages in the region near the border.

The situation in the Kharkiv region is “complex and dynamically changing”, with Russian troops mounting assaults in various areas, Ukraine’s General Staff said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, “more than 30” towns and villages “were struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks”, wounding at least nine people.

Some areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia “carried out 22 assaults” in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said. The General Staff said fighting was ongoing for the border town of Vovchansk, where Russia was deploying “significant forces”.

numbering up to five battalions.

Vovchansk, which previously had a population of 2,500 but now has only 200-300 residents, suffered “massive shelling” on Sunday that hit houses and wounded seven, said Synegubov.

A 69-year-old man was also wounded in the town of Izyum by detonating ammunition and a woman was injured in a village near the town of Kupiansk.

The city of Kharkiv itself had not been struck over the last 24 hours, however, he said.

Synegubov said on national television that “the grey zone and the front line are expanding” because Russia is “trying to deliberately stretch it, attacking in small groups in new directions”.

The DeepState Telegram channel, which is close to the Ukrainian army, wrote that Russia had taken pockets of territory measuring around 100 square kilometres (39 square miles).

Russia “continues to advance to Vovchansk”, the channel said.

“They are gaining foothold on the outskirts for further entry into the town.”

Russia was also advancing towards the border village of Lyptsi and attempting to enter the nearby village of Glyboke, it said.

Ukraine was mounting “constant fire”, including from drones, “but unfortunately it does not stop them”.

The Russian defence ministry said troops had repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Glyboke.

Rybar, a Russian Telegram channel with military links, said Moscow’s offensive led to territorial gains because troops took some villages where Russian soldiers already had a presence and others that were “deserted wastelands”.

As of Monday morning, there were no “large-scale breakthroughs of the enemy’s defences”, Rybar said.

Ukrainian military said Russia was also shelling the Sumy and Chernigiv border regions further west."

SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka 

 The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.

In announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”

Israel’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.

The imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.

The Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.

One might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.

War is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.

Our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.

In the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.

The ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.

The only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.

A struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.

The burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.

 The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned last week that Russia will ramp up its meddling ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections, which preceded European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova assessing that they’d be a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience. This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.

The preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.

Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.

To be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.

The targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.

If the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.

The growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy."

 Israel to respond to genocide charges at UN’s top court

Israel will respond to charges of genocide at the United Nations’ top court on Friday after South Africa filed an urgent request with the court to order a ceasefire in Gaza.

It is the third time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held hearings on the Israel-Hamas war since South Africa filed proceedings at The Hague court in December.

On Thursday, South Africa told the court the situation in Gaza has reached “a new and horrific stage”, and urged the 15 judges to take urgent action.

Israel must “totally and unconditionally withdraw” from the Gaza Strip, said Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands.

South Africa has submitted four requests for the ICJ to investigate Israel. According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.

During hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.

In January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

The court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.

“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.

ICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.

A 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.

Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.

The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.

South Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.

On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.

 Nato in talks to deploy more nuclear weapons amid the growing threat posed by Russia and China - as top Ukrainian security chief warns Putin could firebomb Kyiv with tactical nukes if facing a 'catastrophic defeat'

Nato might deploy more nuclear weapons amid an increasing threat posed by Russia and China, according to the head of the alliance.

Jens Stoltenberg, the 13th secretary general of Nato, revealed there were live discussions among members about removing missiles from storage and putting them on standby to act as a deterrent.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues. That's exactly what we're doing.'

It comes as the head of Kyiv's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko made the comments after G7 leaders warned any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be met with 'severe consequences', The Times reported.

Meanwhile, Mr Stoltenberg warned in Brussels of the threat from China, adding that nuclear transparency should form the basis of Nato's nuclear strategy to prepare the alliance for the dangers of the world.

'Nato's aim is, of course, a world without nuclear weapons, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will remain a nuclear alliance, because a world where Russia, China and North Korea have nuclear weapons, and Nato does not, is a more dangerous world,' he said.

Mr Stoltenberg claimed that China is heavily investing in modern weaponry, which includes its nuclear arsenal, which the secretary general said would increase to 1,000 possibly by 2030.

He insisted the US and its European allies are modernising their nuclear deterrent as a result of heightened threat from Russia.

'The US is modernising their gravity bombs for the nuclear warheads they have in Europe and European allies are modernising the planes which are going to be dedicated to Nato's nuclear mission,' he said.

It comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday accused Russia of not wanting peace, after Putin said he would only accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to halt its NATO ascension plans.

Zelensky made the accusation at the end of a major diplomatic summit in Switzerland, which more than 90 countries attended, making it the largest gathering in support of Ukraine since the start of the invasion.

The conference saw the vast majority of the 90 nations who attended sign a communique in support of Ukraine sovereignty, and also called for Putin to return children stolen during the invasion."

 MOSCOW—Russia said on Sunday that the United States was responsible for a Ukrainian attack on Crimean peninsula with five U.S.–supplied missiles that killed four people, including two children, and injured 151 more.

The Russian Defence Ministry said four of the U.S.–delivered Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, equipped with cluster warheads, were shot down by air defense systems and the ammunition of a fifth had detonated in mid-air.

Footage on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off on sun loungers.

Russian authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen just after noon near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol where locals were on holiday.

The incident generated a furious reaction among Russian public figures.

The Defense Ministry said U.S. specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from U.S. spy satellites, meaning Washington was directly responsible.

“Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out,” the ministry said.

Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The United States began supplying Ukraine with longer range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometre (186-mile) range, earlier this year.

Treating the InjuredSevastopol Governor Mihail Razvozhaev put the death toll at four, with 144 injured, including 82 taken to hospitals. Twenty-seven children were among the injured.

Specialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.

Russia will respond to Sunday’s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been “in constant contact with the military” since the attack.

Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as “a vile, despicable act against our people.”

He likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was “no difference to us” between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and “crazy fanatics.”

Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there “was no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians” and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.

Neither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv."

 In response to EU's recent decision to ban Russian media outlets such as RIA Novosti news agency, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers, the Russian authorities blocked 81 EU publications, including Politico, Spiegel, AFP and a number of others. Moscow promised to review the measure if the EU lifts the ban.

The Russian Foreign Ministry banned the broadcasting of 81 European media outlets in response to similar measures that the European Union earlier took against Russian media.

The most recent move will affect, in particular, Politico, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Der Spiegel (Germany), Yle (Finland), El País (Spain), EUobserver, LRT (Lithuania), the Estonian version of Delfi website and other media.

Moscow's measures come in response to the EU broadcast ban on RIA Novosti, Rossiyskaya Gazeta and Izvestia, as well as Voice of Europe for ""war propaganda.” Brussels found that the Russian government controls these media outlets and uses them to promote and support Russia's military operation in Ukraine, ""as well as to destabilise neighbouring countries.” The EU noted that the measure will not prevent media employees ""from carrying out activities in the EU, with the exception of broadcasting.”

EU's Russian media ban comes into force in the European Union on June 25.

""If restrictions on Russian media are lifted, the Russian side will also reconsider its decision in relation to the mentioned media operators,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Maria Zakharova, an official representative of the department, said on June 24 that Moscow developed responsive measures ""realizing that it was useless to hope for Brussels commitment to international legal obligations.”

Since the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine, the EU has banned broadcasting of a number of Russian media, including NTV/NTV Mir, Rossiya 1, REN TV, Channel One, RT and Sputnik. Certain EU countries, such as, for example, Latvia, banned the broadcasting of 80 Russian TV channels. YouTube channels of many Russian media outlets were also blocked. Pravda.Ru YouTube channel was blocked as well.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

 Russian Plot To Assassinate CEO Of German Arms Giant Dismissed As 'Fake' Intel Story By Kremlin

Top German government and political figures have reacted with outrage to a CNN report alleging that Russian intelligence had plotted to assassinate Armin Papperger, who is the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.

The Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: ""US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.""

There have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.

The CNN report alluded to these prior stories: ""The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said."" It detailed further that ""The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.""

In recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.

As for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.

According to more from the original CNN report, ""When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.""

But Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations as 'fake news': ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,"" he said at the end of the week.

Germany and the US reportedly foiled an alleged plot by Moscow to assassinate a leading German arms manufacturing firm's top executive. Why is Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger a target? pic.twitter.com/3tsi7jvxGU— DW News (@dwnews) July 13, 2024

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock belatedly appeared to confirm that the German government finds the warnings credible. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months: Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression,"" she had told a press briefing at the NATO summit in Washington.

Papperger himself has since described to the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"" - and he's now considered to be the most highly protected private citizen in all of Germany.

Another interesting aspect to the story is the timing: the CNN revelation corresponded precisely to the close of the annual NATO summit in D.C. at a moment Western officials urged the alliance to stay the course on Ukraine, and commit to supplying more weapons for years to come."

 Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó’s accusation that the European Union is “pro-war” completely unacceptable,

“This is totally unacceptable. The European Union is not in favor of war. The European Union is not on the side of war,” Borrell said, adding that the EU is supporting Ukraine in its war against aggression by Russia and wants to end the war in accordance with the UN Charter.

Borrell also said the “unacceptable approach” of the Hungarian government regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s visit to Moscow and Kyiv would be discussed at a separate meeting on Monday.

Borrell noted that member states should be looking at how investment and funding could help Ukraine, such as by restoring its damaged electricity infrastructure as soon as possible and providing additional air defense systems.

“These are the two most important things right now,” he stressed.

Borrell also commented on the opinion issued by the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was delivered on Friday, according to which Israel’s settlement policy and use of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law and Israel must pay reparations to the Palestinians for the damage caused by the occupation.

He said that these conclusions were largely in line with the EU position, which he said was fully consistent with UN resolutions on the status of the occupied Palestinian territories.

“At a time of continuing and increasing violations of international law, we have a moral duty to reaffirm consistently our unwavering commitment to all the rulings of the International Court of Justice, whatever the case in question,” Borrell said."

British colonel: Ukrainian operation in Kursk region humiliated Putin and showed cowardice of allies

The first major attack on Russian territory since World War II, the Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive in the Kursk region, has publicly humiliated Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.

This is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive ""showed the cowardice of the allies,"" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Sir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.

""The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?"" asks the colonel.

According to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ""the most pathetic were the Western allies"" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, ""but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation."" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft ""was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.""

Incidentally, it was these fears and the ""miserable policy"" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.

""Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,"" the colonel said.

""What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,"" Sir Richard Kemp said.

Ukraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a ""salutary lesson,"" the military said.

""Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,"" the British colonel believes.

 The former head of German intelligence has revealed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President of Poland both collaborated to carry out the attack on the Nord Stream Pipelines.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were sabotaged on 26 September 2022 after a series of underwater explosions and gas leaks.

Modernity.news reports: Much of the legacy media initially blamed Russia for attack, claiming it was a false flag but offering no sensible reason as to why Moscow would target its own energy infrastructure.

However, during an appearance on German broadcaster WELT-TV, August Hanning, who served as the head of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, the attack was carried out at the behest of Zelensky and Andrzej Duda.

According to Hanning, the act of sabotage occurred as a result of an “agreement between the highest officials in Ukraine and Poland.”

“There were agreements between Zelensky and Duda to carry out the attack,” said Hanning.

As we highlighted yesterday, Germany issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be involved in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, but Polish authorities failed to stop him at the border and he is now believed to be back in Ukraine.

Berlin issued a European arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen Volodymyr Z. after identifying him as the chief suspect for placing the explosives that destroyed the pipelines, but Polish authorities claimed they didn’t apprehend the suspect as a result of Berlin not including his name in a database of wanted persons.

The pipeline attack was preceded by warnings from the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would spell the end for Nord Stream 2.

On January 27, 2022, Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated, “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”

On February 7, 2022, President Biden said, “If Russia invades… again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.”

In February 2023, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a report asserting that the pipelines were destroyed by the US as part of a covert operation.

According to Hersh’s sources, the explosives were planted in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise and were detonated three months later with a remote signal sent by a sonar buoy.

It remains to be seen conclusively who ordered and carried out the attack, but the argument that Russia was behind it is looking increasingly tenuous."

 New Delhi: Ahead of the presidential election in Nigeria, there has been an explosion of fake news across social media platforms. Divisive content on subjects like religion and ethnicity is also littered across social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp.

According to a report in Al Jazeera, “Social media allows Nigerians to share information in real-time, political strategists are weaponising this ahead of the forthcoming polls.”

A BBC report in January uncovered how Nigerian politicians secretly paid social media influencers as much as 20 million Nigerian naira ($43,000) or promised government contracts and political appointments to spread disinformation about opponents. Some of these influencers are also being recruited to “situation rooms” to monitor the spread of the fake news, the report added.

Meanwhile, Nigeria is grappling with widespread fuel shortages that are forcing motorists to spend hours in lines to buy gas and causing prices to surge for transportation and basic commodities.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused prices to import fuel go up by more than 100% but retailers complain they can only charge the price set by the government, causing them to operate at a loss.

The cost of transporting gasoline to the depots has gone up by 80% in the past few months.

Gasoline shortages are frequent in Nigeria even though the country is one of Africa’s biggest producers of crude oil.

However, the country must import most of its fuel because it has very few functioning refineries.

 Russia – Exposure of ‘dirty bomb’ plans caused panic in Kiev

“Many signs” show Ukraine is winding down its program amid Moscow’s revelations, a senior diplomat claimed

Kiev might be shelving its alleged ‘dirty bomb’ program after Russia exposed it, Moscow’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday. He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.

Over the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.

“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.

In his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.

“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.

At the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”

Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”

On Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”

“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”

Meanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.

 Ukraine: You Break It, We Take It

Authored by Citizen Soldier via RealClearDefense,

All Aboard! Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.

Last week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Like an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a ""caution"" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.

Our government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.

No-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.

Not everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?

The DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.

The elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.

Blinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.

 RUSSIA has snatched nearly 300 children from a Ukrainian city in the past month sending them to military camps to become ""Russian zombies.""

Ruthless child snatchers have abducted a total of 280 kids from the annexed Antratsytiv district in Luhansk, according to a report.

The children were then taken to the Cossack cadet corps in Russia's Kalmykia region.

According to figures from Ukraine's National Resistance Center, Moscow plans to kidnap a total of 500 Ukrainian children by the end of summer.

The report claims that the children are not only abducted but sent to be ""zombified with aggressive propaganda"" by Vladimir Putin's forces.

It is estimated Russia has kidnapped well over 20,000 Ukrainian children since the start of the war, and sent them to be brainwashed and tortured.

A Ukrainian teenager told earlier this month how he was kidnapped from school and shipped off to a hellhole Russian camp.

Vitaliy Vertash, 16, told how he was stuck in a room with four others - and they were only fed soup and buckwheat while facing beatings from the ""camp employees"".

The true horrors of the ""re-education camps"" echo that of Nazi Germany, and have turned countless innocent children into ""Russian Zombies"".

Last year, a Sun investigation revealed Vlad's crony Maria Lvova Belova had headed up an organisation tasked with putting kidnapped Ukrainian children into Russian homes.

Meanwhile, up to 5,000 adults were also kidnapped by Russian forces in besieged Mariupol and sent to work camps in Russia.

Some were forced to wear overlarge Russian military uniforms that could make them a target while others dug mass graves for their fallen comrades in the Russian-held region of Zaporizhzhia.

One man who refused to dig was shot on the spot.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained across Russia in centres ranging from brand-new wings in Russian prisons to hellhole basements.

And it is likely Russia is planning to hold much more, in line with Putin's plan of erasing the Ukrainian culture.

And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more.

A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.

The Russian dictator signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law, which includes all of occupied Ukraine, to those without, such as Russia.

This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia.

Many civilians are picked up for alleged transgressions as minor as speaking Ukrainian or simply being a young man in an occupied region, and are often held without charge.

Others are charged as terrorists, combatants, or people who “resist the special military operation.”

Hundreds are used for slave labour by Russia’s military, for digging trenches and other fortifications, as well as mass graves."

 Australian Open bans flags from Russia and Belarus on site

Flags from Russia and Belarus were banned from the site of the Australian Open on Tuesday after more than one was brought into the stands by spectators on the first day of the Grand Slam tournament.

Normally, flags can be displayed during matches at Melbourne Park. But Tennis Australia suspended that policy for the two countries involved in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a year ago.

“Our initial policy was that fans could bring [flags] in but could not use them to cause disruption,” Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside. We will continue to work with the players and our fans to ensure that this is the best possible environment to enjoy the tennis.”

One Russian flag was displayed during Ukrainian player Kateryna Baindl’s 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-1 victory over Russian player Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 14 in the first round Monday.

Another was offered to Russian player Daniil Medvedev to autograph after his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 win over Marcos Giron in Rod Laver Arena on Monday night.

Asked about the new flag ban, Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka said after her first-round victory Tuesday that she would prefer that politics and sports remain separate but that she understands the decision by Tennis Australia.

Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff each pick up wins in the first round of the Australian Open as they begin their quest for a first Grand Slam title.

“I mean, if everyone feels better this way, then it’s OK,” said Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist who is seeded No. 5 at Melbourne Park. “I have zero control on it. What can I say? They did it. OK. No flags? No flags.”

Sabalenka was among the athletes from Russia and Belarus who were barred last year from competing at Wimbledon and team events such as the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup because of the war in Ukraine. Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.

Russian and Belarusian players have been allowed to enter the other three Grand Slam tournaments but as “neutral” athletes, so their nationalities are not acknowledged on any official schedules or results for the event and their countries’ flags are not displayed on TV graphics."

 THIS is the astonishing moment a Ukrainian armoured vehicle bravely takes on a vastly more powerful Russian tank in a ferocious firefight - and WINS.

The astounding video filmed from a drone appears to show a Ukrainian BTR-4 raining hell on the invaders' tank in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.

The BTR-4 appears to unload a volley of rounds from its 30mm cannon causing severe damage to Putin's war machine - despite it having 40mm armour.

Rounds can be seen streaking through the air in the dramatic David and Goliath struggle.

And after pounding what is believed to be a Russian T-72 tank - a ferocious inferno engulfs and then obliterates it leaving the machine in tatters.

The humiliating scenes come despite Putin's battle tanks being fitted with 125mm cannons - more than FOUR TIMES the size of a BTR-4.

READ MORE UKRAINE STORIES

Its main gun can fire armour-piercing shells and highly explosive rounds.

It can also launch AT-11 laser guided anti-tank missiles.

But the 44.5 tonne tanks are less mobile and quick to aim than nippy troop carriers like the BTR-4, whose cannons can rapid-fire.

The T-72 and other variants of it has seen extensive use on both sides in the war in the Donbas since 2014 and the Russo-Ukrainian.

Most read in World News

It is a family of Soviet/Russian main battle tanks that entered production in 1969.

Latest estimates suggest Putin's savages have now lost an eyewatering 756 battle tanks since the war began on February 24.

That comes alongside estimates that Russia has lost an astonishing 20,000 men in just 50-days of war.

They have also seen 163 planes and 144 helicopters blasted out the sky above war ravaged Ukraine.

Russia's latest military humiliation comes as the Kremlin redeploys forces eastward after a disaster campaign to take the capital Kyiv.

REDEPLOYMENT

Putin is now focusing efforts in the Donbas region which has been gripped by war between government forces and pro-Russian separatists since 2014.

Russia annexed Crimea the same year and recognize the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas.

Moscow now intends to forge a strategic corridor between Crimea and its own sovereign territory via the Donbas.

It means roads such as the one shown in the video will remain scenes of intense fighting for months to come.

It comes as the Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such an effort, according to a senior U.S. defence official.

And worryingly it is likely to insert more ground combat units in the region once it has regrouped after shouldering massive losses.

But it's unclear precisely when Russia will launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas.

It comes as Russia's flagship Moskva was sunk after an extraordinary missile attack by the Ukrainians.

HUMILIATION

The ship - a 40-year-old symbol of Russian military might - was left a smouldering wreck after taking direct hits from two Neptune anti-ship missiles.

The ship later sunk as it was being towed to naval port Sevastopol in Crimea.

First Rank Captain Anton Kuprin, 44, was killed after the ship was hammered by the missiles, according to Kyiv sources.

It has been alleged that only around 50 of the crew are accounted for - having been picked up by a Turkish vessel.

While another 14 were reportedly flown to the port of Sevastopol, leaving around 450 whose fates remain a mystery.

Video from within in Sevastopol overnight shows dozens of cars purportedly belonging to the sailors still parked in the port - suggesting their owners haven't come to collect them.

The sinking of the Soviet-era Moskva in the Black Sea prompted Russia to launch a furious retaliation, later claiming to have blitzed the factory which made the missiles that sunk their prized flagship.

The defence ministry said it had rocketed the 'Vizar' plant on the edge of Kyiv on Thursday night which it says manufactures Neptune anti-ship missiles.

Russian Vladimir Putin, craving bloody revenge for the sinking, then ordered a brutal new bombing campaign promising more strikes against the Ukrainian capital.

In a statement, Russia defence ministry said: ""The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime.""

Strikes later rocked the capital Kyiv on Thursday night, according to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko.

Social media videos have shown the sky above Kyiv lit up by countless explosions - they appear to be the most serious attacks since Russia retreated from the capital earlier this month.

While blasts were also heard in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk.

 Warning US could be ‘hit with most debilitating strike EVER’ in space war with Russia after chilling ISS threat

THE US could be hit with the most debilitating and destructive strike ever in a potential space war with Russia, an expert warns.

Relations between Moscow and Washington have plunged to new lows amid the Ukrainian crisis, and Russia’s space agency warned that US sanctions could “destroy” cooperation on the International Space Station.

Moscow claimed Washington needs its cooperation to prevent the ISS from falling on the US or Europe.

Geopolitical and space expert Brandon J Weichert told The Sun that Moscow has a decade to a 12-year advantage on the US in the galaxies.

He said US defenses are in “no way fit” to deal with the challenges posed by Russia.

Weichert warned: “We are going to get hit very hard soon in space. It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America, possibly ever.

“And we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”

Weichert slammed the ""arrogant"" DC political class, claiming they didn’t foresee any rival challenging Washington’s dominance in the post-Cold-War world.

Most read in The Sun

He said: “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventative or security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.

“Well here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”

The expert feared that the US has a 60 percent chance of being pushed out of space by its rivals completely.

President Biden unleashed a package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Putin’s forces rolled into Ukraine.

And, an additional 7,000 troops will be sent to Eastern Europe to bolster Nato’s defenses.

Russia’s invasion of the besieged nation saw Europe plunged into its biggest crisis since World War II.

Experts claim the world has not seen a crisis since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.

The flashpoint was the closest point the world came to a full-blown nuclear war.

US intelligence feared that Kyiv could fall within 96 hours and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it’s a “possibility” that Putin could move beyond the borders of Ukraine.

The Russian strongman may feel emboldened and seek to move on to other nations if successful.

Troops have reportedly already been spotted in the Belarussian city of Brest – 10 miles east of the Polish border.

Biden told reporters Thursday: “He has much larger ambitions. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about.”

Weichert said: “If Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.

“Putin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.”

He speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.

PUTIN'S THREATS

In December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.

The Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.

In his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.

He predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.

Weichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a ""devastating"" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.

He warned that before launching an attack on Washington’s satellites, Moscow would ""engage in a series of escalations” with neighboring nations.

Russia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.

Blinken branded the test ""dangerous and irresponsible"" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.

 Zelensky Seeks To Cancel Russia At UN, Asks Why ""Russian Terrorists"" Have A Place

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to use his visit to the United Nations in New York to get Russia canceled from the international assembly. He questioned how it is that ""Russian terrorists"" have a seat at the UN. He also warned that Russia is poised to expand its war beyond Ukraine - an assertion with no evidence.

""If in the United Nations there is a place for Russian terrorists,"" Zelensky said, ""it’s a question to all the members of the United Nations."" ...Except that of course Russia doesn't hold just any UN seat, but it's permanent member of the UN Security Council, and exercises veto power in that capacity over the UNSC's most important resolutions and major decisions.

Zelensky made the comments on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), when he visited a hospital in Staten Island which is treating some 18 wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Zelensky has long warned that the UN is ""hostage"" to Russian policy.

As for his UNGA speech the same day, given before some 140 nations, and after Biden spoke earlier, Zelensky went on the verbal attack against Russia, giving comments in English.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said. He laid out that Russia is weaponizing essentials for survival like food and energy.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said, also seeking to portray a pattern of Putin's ""aggression"" from Georgia to Syria to Moldova.

He also alleged Moscow is committing ""genocide"" - and repeated media claims of Russia having ""kidnapped"" some tens of thousands of children. ""Time goes by; what will happen to them?” He then called it ""clearly a genocide.""

However, these reports of ""Russia kidnapping children"" have been based on the trend of Russian-speaking families of the Donbas in many cases willingly relocating to Russian territory, also given there had been a civil war raging there since 2014 involving pro-Kiev Ukrainians attacking pro-Russian Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Zelensky also used it as an occasion to condemn any potential peace plan offered by a third party which requires that Ukraine cede territory. The New York Times wrote, ""Ukraine has been seeking backing for a 10-point settlement program that demands a full Russian withdrawal and payment of reparations.""

""Zelensky pitched the audience an idea for a summit with that program on the agenda -- something Ukrainian diplomats say would be a symbolic success, even without any means to enforce such a settlement on Russia,"" the report noted.

The UN audience applauded when at the end of his remarks Zelensky said the world must work to ""end the aggression on the terms of the state that was attacked."" He's expected to later travel to Washington, where he'll lobby for billions more in American taxpayer dollars to be pledged toward the war effort.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

The World Economic Forum (WEF) which represents the Western financial elites, played a key role in the launching of the March 11, 2020 corona lockdown, which was conducive to a Worldwide process of economic and social chaos. It also played a key role in the launching of the Covid-19 vaccine. in November 2020.

And now they are “promising” us a crisis which is “Much Worse than Covid”.

Over the last three years the deliberate triggering of chaos has become part of a broad and complex agenda: the war in Ukraine, the hike in energy prices, the triggering of bankruptcies, the collapse of economic activity, widespread poverty, famine and despair.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In recent developments, Washington has endorsed Israel’s genocide directed against the People of Palestine, coupled with an unfolding US-NATO-Israel military agenda against the broader Middle East.

Cyber-Attacks

The article below focusses on the imminent dangers of Cyber Warfare, which have already been announced by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

In 2021, the WEF conducted a simulation of Cyber Attacks involving a scenario of Paralysis of the Power Supply, Communications, Transportation, The Internet.

Klaus Schwab intimated in no uncertain terms based on “a simulated scenario” that a cyber-attack:

“Could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole …

The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.” (emphasis added)

What does Schwab have up his sleeve?

A “Cyber Terrorist Attack” conducive to unprecedented disruptions? Is this something that we should take seriously?

A renewed fear campaign, a warning of an impending danger? In the words of Jeremy Jurgens, who is the WEF’s Managing Director:

“I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we’ve seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.” (emphasis added)

The 2021 WEF cyber polygon simulation scenario had an obvious “contradictory” geopolitical slant:

The event was chaired by Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, numerous Russian financial institutions, media and communications entities had been invited by the WEF.

Forty-eight countries participated in the Event, there were 41 partners of which 10 were from Russia and Kazakhstan: these included News Agency TASS, NTV, Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank and a leading global financial institution, the Mail.ru Group, Russia’s largest internet provider, MTS, Russia’s leading telecommunications group, the State Legal Department of the Omsk Region, Siberia. Powerful banking financial institutions from Kazakstan. Among others.

See also the assumptions of the Training Program, which are predicated on terrorist cyber hackers.

Amply documented, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been instrumental in endorsing US-NATO’s military agenda in regards to Ukraine.

Was this July 2021 Cyber Polygon event (which occurred less than 8 months prior to the outset of the Ukraine War) intent upon creating political divisions within the Russian Federation by establishing partnerships with a number of powerful Russian media, communications, banking and financial institutions, etc.

Not a single representative from the People’s Republic of China. Was the Cyber Polygon Simulation (July 2021) intended to foster confrontation between China and Russia? Are Cyber attacks contemplated as part of a Global Military agenda?

The Process of “All-Digitization”

In November 2023, as documented in an article by Peter Koenig, the Financial Elites passed from the “study of scenarios” to “implementation”. They entrusted the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) “as the flag-carrier … for the deadly onslaught of All-Digitization.”"
EN_UA_101067.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"First war of TikTok era sees tragedy, humor and deceit 

 eart-rending videos of artillery strikes are being served up alongside funny snippets such as bomb-shelter cooking tips and invasion misinformation as the war in Ukraine plays out on TikTok.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, millions of people have tuned into the hugely popular social networking service for news and views of what is happening on the battleground.

That was not lost on United States officials who hosted a video call to brief popular TikTok ""influencers"" on details about the war, according to posts at the social network.

""Lots of people have been turning to digital creators to learn about the invasion of Ukraine,"" read a tweet Friday by Gen-Z for Change, a nonprofit focused on using social media to promote civil discourse.

""Yesterday, we joined the @WhiteHouse and @WHNSC for a briefing on the United States' strategic goals in Ukraine so we're better able to debunk misinformation,"" it added, referring to the White House National Security Council.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, music-themed video clips in Marta Vasyuta's account gave way to images of soldiers and the ravages of war.

Stuck in London, the 20-year-old Ukrainian exchange student uses TikTok to share glimpses of the tragedy inflicted on people still in her home country.

""My mission is to spread information, to not stop talking about that, because it really matters,"" said the economics student from Lviv, whose videos have logged millions of views.

Valeria Shashenok stayed in the city of Cherniguiv, northeast of Kyiv, and switched to English to broaden the reach of her sometimes surreal wartime TikTok posts.

In one, she shows how to cook borscht in a bomb shelter. In another, she walks through rubble to a Rihanna music remix.

The 20-year-old photographer is among those who have not given up on the playful nature of videos considered a trademark of TikTok, which boasts more than 1 billion users.

""I try to keep the humor, because it is my nature,"" said 23-year-old TikTok creator Rimma, who asked for her second name to be withheld.

""I'm living through this trauma. My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.""

Her TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.

She said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.

But the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.

Youthful sass

While breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.

In the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.

""I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,"" said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.

""What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.""

Young TikTok users were also being ""bombarded"" with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.

TikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter ""emerging threats"" and ""harmful disinformation"" on the platform.

On March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to ""discredit"" the Russian military.

The flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

 German bosses, unions jointly oppose boycott of Russian gas

Germany’s employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying such a move would lead to factory shutdowns and the loss of jobs in the bloc’s largest economy.

“A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further de-industrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,” said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the BDA employer’s group, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the DGB trade union confederation, in a joint statement Monday on Germany’s dpa news agency.

The statement comes as European leaders are discussing possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.

That won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.

Germany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.

German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”

Despite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.

Analysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%."

 A FORMER football star has joined an army unit of Russian hooligans on the frontline in Ukraine.

It comes as the battalion - led by an ultra dubbed The Spaniard - steps up recruitment in a desperate bid to boost ranks as Russian invaders continue to meet stiff Ukrainian resistance.

The brigade, named Espanola, is filled with thugs from the terraces and has now been given special status among armed forces backing Vladimir Putin.

Hooligans were recruited too, but now the unit is classed as a separate private military company, with the go-ahead to expand recruitment.

The ultras are urged: ""Get into the coolest adventures of your life with a real chance to come back alive from these scrapes.”

They are promised a “decent reward” for turning their violent instincts on Ukraine.

More on Russia

Former Russian international footballer Andrey Solomatin, 47, has signed up.

He played for Moscow clubs CSKA and Lokomotiv.

Stanislav Orlov, commander of Española private military company, said: “We were volunteers, then part of the DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic] forces.

“Recently we managed to get separate status. So now we do not belong to any battalions or divisions.""

Most read in Football

Orlov, whose call sign is ""Spaniard"", said they had been given approval to create a separate battalion, Espanola.

The hooligans’ battalion is 550 strong, including 100 operators of kamikaze drones used to attack Ukraine, he said.

The fighters say they are being equipped by football supporters from across Russia.

Orlov said: “There are a huge number of them.

“All over Russia, in fact - in different cities there are different football teams.

“We tell them what we need [and they provide it].""

Five years ago, Putin’s regime desperately tried to crackdown on Russian hooligans and ultras - using an FSB crackdown to stop them ruining the FIFA World Cup, which Putin hosted.

In 2016, Russian hooligans were in pitch battles with English fans at the UEFA Euro tournament in France.

Now they are formalised as an armed force, and seen as heroes.

Espanola is currently recruiting “stormtroopers”, scout-saboteurs, snipers, drone operators, electronic warfare and air defence operators, portable ground reconnaissance station operators, anti-tank guided missile operators, anti aircraft specialists, communications specialists, mechanic-drivers, and medics.

Would-be fighters are told they will “take a quick but deep course of study in all directions with a real opportunity - or rather the need - to become a ‘universal soldier’.”

They will “become a real military man and benefit the Motherland without delay”.

And the stadium fighters will “get access and learn how to work with the most modern weapons, equipment and technologies"".

Sniper detachments “are provided with all the most advanced technologies — this applies to transport, equipment, and of course [guns].”

Recruits are told they “may not be hooligans, but they should be close to us in spirit and comply with the main principles of Española in life”.

Recruitment sessions have been held in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as other cities.

They boast recruits from the hooligan armies of clubs like CSKA, Zenit, Spartak, Torpedo and Lokomotiv and the notorious Orel Butchers.

Several are known to have died so far in the war, including CSKA Moscow fan Maxim Shmanin, 44.

 BRITISH GOVERNMENT’S NOVICHOK INQUIRY REVEALS THAT ITS NOVICHOK CASE OFFICERS ARE ALSO THE GOVERNMENT’S UKRAINE WARFIGHTERS

By John Helmer, Moscow

@bears_with

The British Government has admitted over the weekend that its troops currently running the British war in the Ukraine are also engaged in managing the document file for the alleged Novichok attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March 2018.

The disclosure appears in the text of a document signed by Cathryn McGahey KC, dated October 31, and released on the website of the

Dawn Sturgess Inquiry chaired by Lord Anthony Hughes (lead image left). “The war in Ukraine has required”, McGahey (right), a barrister representing the government ministries, wrote to Hughes, “and continues to require work to be undertaken by many of the same individuals and resources who are working on disclosures. Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.”

McGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.

According to McGahey, “approximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant” to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government’s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.

As Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, “the responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.”

Exactly what roles in the Ukraine war the “subject matter experts” are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.

McGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn’t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. “There are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty’s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.”

Hughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.

“The risk of damage to national security here,” he said, ” lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary… [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.”

Make no mistake - the West wanted Russia to invade the Ukraine.

They goaded Russia into it deliberately, then abandoned Ukraine for all intents and purposes.

It’s part of their plan to bring the entire world down so they can build it up again in their image.

Russia is going to attack the USA.

Again, this is what the West wants.

The entire show fits in with their demonic vaccination operation.

The Russian attack will finish what the vaccinations and the sanctions started

This is the work of mad people.

This is the work of Satan.

The West represents human civilization at its peak.

And war is part of the plan to reverse that.

Putin has stated that being cut off from Swift is equivalent to a nuclear attack.

The consequence of which must entail a retaliatory nuclear attack.

That is the conclusion we must read into that statement.

Part of the reason for attacking Ukraine was to get rid of the nazis and junkies.

The USA is the symbolic embodiment of both.

The problem for Russia is the Antichrist not Biden.

He it is who is behind the vaccinations, degeneracy, economic implosion, religious sellout and finally nuclear war.

If I am aware of him I’m sure, as Prince Charles of England has hinted, others are aware of him as well.

Not sure but I believe most Western leaders are as well, having signed up to the genocide via voluntary injection.

His next objective is mandatory injection and for that they need sprawling camp detentions everywhere.

Once detained these people will be subjected to torture then killed as they do not fit into their plans.

Western leaders have already fallen and unless they are forcefully replaced by the popular vote they are the central core of the satanic plan unfolding like clockwork.

However by taking out the USA, the rest of Europe will fold to Putin and the tough threats will not be ignored and the Antichrist will be defeated.

America will still survive but it will be freed from demonic entrapment with the intent to enslavement.

 A 'Watershed Event': Five Takeaways From Israel's Assassination Of Hamas' Political Leader In Tehran

Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,

Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by Israel early Wednesday morning in the heart of the Iranian capital hours after attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration. The details remain unclear, but it’s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.

Here are five takeaways thus far:

1. Israel’s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch

Israel somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh’s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.

2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond

It’s unimaginable that Iran won’t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president’s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.

3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone’s Head

The response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership’s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they’ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring’s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that’s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.

4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most “Rational”…

Duma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region’s acting head in spring 2014, described spring’s salvo as a “beautiful theatrical production”. If there’s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel’s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh’s assassination, which could help Iran “save face” while averting an escalation towards MAD.

5. …But There’s No Guarantee That Iran’s Allies Will “Stand Down”

Hamas and Hezbollah are Iran’s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties. There’s accordingly no guarantee that they’ll “stand down” and not respond in their own way if Iran sends another salvo to Israel regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed. After all, Hamas’ political chief was just killed, while one of Hezbollah’s top commanders was assassinated by Israel in Beirut the day prior. This makes the MAD risk even less manageable since those two might not share Iran’s calculations.

Haniyeh’s assassination is a watershed event in the latest Israeli-Hamas War, which is now a regional Israeli-Iranian proxy war, since it greatly spikes the risk of everything spiraling into MAD.

Iran’s response will be crucial in determining whether or not that happens, but so too will Hamas and Hezbollah’s.

They’ll either “stand down” as Iran responds regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed, participate in a joint response that remains below the MAD threshold, or decide to cross that red line on their own."

The UK is preparing to slam sanctions on banks and oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to turn the thumbscrews on Russia.

British combat soldiers are unlikely to be sent to fight, with the PM instead preferring to cripple Russian firms.

Mr Clarke said this morning: ""We are very clear that if Russia takes further action against Ukraine, then we will further tighten the sanctions regimes targeting those businesses, and people with the closest links to the Kremlin.

""Brexit Britain is one of the foremost opponents of the actions of the Putin regime and if you look at the EU, it is countries like Germany who are dragging their feet when it comes to the the response to this crisis.

""We are the ones tightening the sanctions regime, making sure that we support our NATO allies and standing up to Putin in a way which frankly is leading the continent rather than following."""
EN_UA_102034.txt,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']","Most Taiwanese do not view US as ‘trustworthy’, but majority trusts its security commitment for island: Survey 

 A majority of Taiwanese do not consider the United States a “trustworthy” country, despite expressing belief in Washington’s security commitment to the island, according to a recent survey conducted by National Chengchi University in Taipei.

According to South China Morning Post, the annual survey, which polled 1,211 Taiwanese adults in September, found that only 34 per cent agreed that the US is trustworthy, maintaining the same level as the previous year when it fell from 43.4 per cent in 2021.

Yet as American credibility remained stable, more than 50 per cent did not deem the US “trustworthy” in the survey of 1,211 Taiwanese adults conducted in September, although China fared significantly worse.

Analysts attribute this skepticism to the unfolding events in Ukraine and how the US government responded to Russia’s invasion.

“We suspect that the drop may have come from the occurrence of the Ukraine war and how the United States government responded,” South China Morning Post quoted Hsin-Hsin Pan, a member of the survey team at Taipei’s Soochow University, as saying.

“Washington’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine indicates to many Taiwanese how the US might respond if Beijing were to engage in armed conflict with the island,” Pan added.

Despite the mixed views on the US, perceptions of China were consistently negative.

Only 9.3 per cent of respondents considered China “trustworthy,” a slight decrease from last year’s 9.4 per cent and 13.5 per cent in 2021. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has asserted its intention to reunite it with the mainland, even if force is necessary.

While the US does not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent country and adheres to a one-China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 legally binds Washington to “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character” and maintain the capacity to resist any form of coercion.

President Joe Biden has reiterated the US commitment to intervene militarily should China use force against Taiwan.

The survey also indicated strong support for American arms sales to Taiwan, with over 65 per cent of respondents expressing approval. Approximately 57 per cent believed that the US would use force to assist Taiwan if Beijing attempted to unilaterally change the status quo.

The findings highlight a notable gap between the overall credibility of the US and the credibility of its security commitment to Taiwan. Analysts emphasise that more people are willing to assign credibility to the US security commitment to Taiwan than to the US overall.

Regarding the question of whether Taiwan and China belong to the same country, about 78 per cent of those polled rejected this idea.

Notably, more than 50 per cent of Kuomintang party members or supporters, who generally favor closer ties with Beijing, also asserted that Taiwan and China are not part of the same country. This suggests a disconnect between the KMT party stance and the beliefs of its support base.

As Taiwan approaches its presidential election scheduled for January 13, the political landscape is becoming increasingly complex.

The election is expected to focus on local health and welfare issues, as well as relations with Beijing and the island’s sovereignty.

With regional tensions rising, the outcome of the election is seen as a potential turning point for the island’s future relations with China and the United States. The winning party will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these relationships amidst evolving geopolitical challenges.

 UK intelligence experts are concerned that Russia will use “fabricated” claims regarding chemical weapons in Ukraine to move forward with a “false-flag operation.”

“Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation. Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” officials said, adding that such a “false-flag” attack would “almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”

Officials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.

However, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin’s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.

Yet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

In response to Russia’s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is “total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.”

The UK Ministry of Defence’s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.

The NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK’s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.

“Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime,” Price said."

 Putin Deploys Troops Along Finland Border In Response To NATO Accession

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in fresh remarks that Finland and Sweden’s entry into NATO are ""a meaningless step"" but that in response Moscow will still deploy troops and ""systems of destruction"" to the Finnish border after Finland joined the alliance.

""Frankly speaking, I don’t understand why they need this. This is an absolutely meaningless step from the point of view of ensuring their own national interests,"" Putin said.

""We generally had ideal relations with Finland, simply ideal. We did not have a single claim against each other, especially territorial ones,"" Putin continued, before saying that Finland's NATO accession was really born out of a desire to ""join the Western club"".

""We didn't even have troops; we removed all the troops from there, from the Russian-Finnish border,"" he said. ""However, it is up to them to decide. That's what they decided. But we didn't have troops there, now we will.""

Finland became the 31st member of the alliance last April, but it was on Monday that Sweden formally became the 32nd at a flag raising ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said expressly at the ceremony that his country abandoned historic neutrality as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""The Russian, brutal, full-scale invasion against Ukraine united Sweden behind the conclusion that a full-fledged NATO membership is the only reasonable choice,"" Kristersson said.

On Wednesday soaring tensions between Russia and Nordic countries were on display during new remarks of Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

He claimed in a speech before European Parliament that Moscow is preparing for a ""long conflict with the West"" and ""represents a permanent and essential military threat to Europe.""

""If we, as a united Europe, fail to respond sufficiently to this challenge, the coming years will be filled with danger and the looming threat of attack,"" he said, before adding: ""Russia is not invincible.""

Denmark too is among those calling for increased defense spending and greater coordination on European defense. This has been a persistent talking point over the last months as Ukraine forces are not fairing well on the battlefield, and as Washington funds have dried up. European leaders are urgently trying to fill the gap of stalled US funds to Kiev."

 The Ukraine War, How the British Derailed Peace

BATTLEFORWORLD.COM | November 25, 2023: Ex-Pentagon analyst revealed that the West refused to support the Ukraine-Russia peace talks and is now seeking a way out.

The leader of the Servant of the People faction in the Ukrainian parliament, Davyd Arakhamia, disclosed that the March 2022 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks was a no go because then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought the negotiations to zero, to have Ukraine continue the conflict. And to pressure the Kiev regime, that was when the “Bucha massacre” appeared at the appropriate time to derailed the peace talks that was ongoing in Turkey.

The Bucha massacre was later debunked by Russia as a hoax, but the damage was already done to smear Russia on the world stage, to which the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued along pushing the war stroking the conflict as various countries kept on supplying all sorts of weapons.

According to Arakhamia, the Russians were willing to end the conflict if Ukraine was to agree to neutrality and provide guarantees to not join NATO. Arakhamia referenced an interview he gave to Ukrainian TV channel 1+1, saying: “When we returned from Istanbul, Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said: ‘We won’t sign anything with them at all, and let’s just fight’.”

 by Ethan Huff, Natural News:

The reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the “lab leak” that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.

These and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News‘ Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“I think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,” Kennedy told Watters and viewers. “They were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.”

Kennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.

“I think he caused a lot of injury,” Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. “I think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe’s population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.”

RFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autism

Unlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as “fake news.”

“There were countries that did the opposite of what we did that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their population, and had 1/200th of our death rate,” Kennedy said.

Concerning the subject of vaccines, Kennedy clarified for Watters and viewers his longtime position that poison jabs do, in fact, cause autism – though that does not necessarily mean that he opposes vaccines being legal, just so long as sound science is able to back them.

“I do believe that autism comes from vaccines,” Kennedy revealed. “But I think most of the things people believe about my opinions about vaccines are wrong. I, you know, all I have said about vaccines is we should have good science.”

“We should have the same kind of testing, placebo-controlled trials that we have for every other medication. Vaccines are exempt from pre-licensing placebo-controlled trials. There’s no way that anybody can tell the risk profile of those products or even the relative benefits of those products before they’re mandated, and we should have that kind of testing.”

Be sure to watch the interview with Kennedy below:

One commenter noted that he agrees with Kennedy in that COVID was “cultivated” and “intentionally released at just the right time, one year before a U.S. presidential election.”

“It was perfect timing for Biden’s campaign to use it against Trump while they were working hard in the background to hide all of Biden’s corruption,” this person added. “I think they are also funding labs in Ukraine as well. That and NATO membership is one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded.”"

 Millions left with no aid as West Africa suffers worst hunger crisis in 10 years, U.N. says

The U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday that millions of hungry people in West Africa are without aid as the agency struggles with limited funding to respond to the region’s worst hunger crisis in a decade.

Nearly half of the 11.6 million people targeted for food aid during the June to August lean season are not receiving any assistance, the agency said in a statement. It warned that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of joining armed groups, getting married early or engaging in “survival sex” in their desperation to survive.

“We’re in a tragic situation. During this year’s lean season, millions of families will lack sufficient food reserves to sustain them until the next harvests in September,” said Margot Vandervelden, WFP interim regional director for Western Africa. “We must take immediate action to prevent a massive slide into catastrophic hunger,” she said.

Long before last year’s flooding and Russia’s war in Ukraine, West Africa already was facing its worst food crisis in 10 years with more than 27 million hungry people mainly as a result of conflicts but also due to drought and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 50 million people in the wider East African region are expected to face acute food insecurity this year.

Food insecurity in West and Central Africa is now affecting 47.2 million people in this year’s lean season, when hunger peaks, the WFP said, with women and children the most vulnerable groups.

“Malnutrition rates have also surged, with 16.5 million children under 5 set to be acutely malnourished this year — an 83% rise from the 2015-2022 average,” the agency said.

In central Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger where jihadists have become increasingly deadly, U.N. agencies estimate that the number of people fleeing violence there has nearly quadrupled from 30,000 in January to 110,000 people in June.

“We need a twin-track approach to stop hunger in the Sahel — we must address acute hunger through humanitarian assistance while tackling the structural causes of food insecurity by increasing investments in resilient food systems and expanding government social protection programs,” Vandervelden added."

 Erdogan – Moscow and Kiev agree exchange of 200 prisoners

Russia releases captured Western mercenary fighters – Reuters

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has mediated the release by Russia of ten foreign combatants in the Ukraine conflict, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry announced on Wednesday. Hailing from five countries, the mercenaries had been captured while fighting for Kiev.

The prisoners, who are citizens of Croatia, Morocco, Sweden, the UK and the US, were transferred from Russia to Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, according to a statement from the ministry. Saudi officials are now “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries,” the announcement continued.

Bin Salman personally negotiated the release, which took place as part of a wider exchange of prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, the ministry added.

The full details of the POW exchange are unclear, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 200 prisoners. This exchange would be the largest such swap since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in February.

Erdogan, whose government helped broker a deal earlier this summer to restart grain shipments from Ukrainian ports, said this exchange represented “a very important step.”

In addition to receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of Western arms, Ukraine has leaned heavily on foreign mercenaries to bolster its military. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, more than 2,000 of these foreign fighters have been eliminated by Russian troops and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.

Shoigu said on Wednesday that just over 1,000 foreigners remain active in the ranks of the Ukrainian military. The Russian minister added that more than 150 NATO officers and advisers are in Kiev, where they are planning and commanding Ukraine’s forces.

 MSM Admits ""Magical Thinking"" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine... Many Thousands Of Deaths Later

A very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him ""the world's most hated thinker.""

But now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...

The War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are “Magical Thinking.” In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023

The WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on ""magical thinking"".

Or else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:

What Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.

Elsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:

As Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...

Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.

The tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023

Of course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.

On a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...

Zelensky has recently complained that ""Russia's goal"" to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less ""magical thinking"" these days.

 A Moscow court on Monday disclosed that several Russian artists, who were labeled as “foreign agents” for publically supporting the Ukrainian government, have submitted appeals against the tagging.

According to the Zamoskvorechye district court, appeals have been filed by TV host and comedian Maksim Galkin, actor and musician Semyon Slepakov, blogger Ilya Varlamov, and singer Zemfira.

All four individuals left Russia last year and were branded as foreign agents following their public statements in favour of Kiev.

Galkin, who was designated as a foreign agent in September 2022 for engaging in “political activities” on behalf of a foreign government, appeared in a video where he was heard chanting slogans of Ukrainian nationalists during a concert in Dubai, which surfaced in January.

Galkin, a comedian known for hosting Russia’s version of the quiz show ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ from 2001 to 2008, had performed alongside Ukraine’s future President Vladimir Zelensky in a New Year’s Eve special in 2013.

Galkin, aged 46, and his wife, 73-year-old Soviet pop icon Alla Pugacheva, fled to Israel during the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.

Pugacheva condemned Galkin’s designation and expressed her demand to be included on the list as well.

Last week, Zemfira, a rock musician who rose to fame in the early 2000s, submitted her appeal to the court, according to reports.

Born as Zemfira Ramazanova, she was added to the foreign agent list in February 2023 after criticizing the “war in Ukraine” and relocating to France.

Towards the end of March, Varlamov’s inclusion in the registry was announced.

As per the Russian Ministry of Justice, the architect and video-blogger specializing in urbanism was accused of spreading false information about government policies and receiving support from foreign entities.

Notably, Varlamov had already departed from Russia by that time and claimed to have obtained a passport from Turkmenistan.

On April 14, Slepakov was designated as a foreign agent.

The Justice Ministry justified this decision by citing his receipt of support from foreign sources, his opposition to the special military operation in Ukraine, and his involvement in promoting negative sentiments towards the Russian people, military, and government.

In a satirical song released in January, Slepakov portrayed a Russian mother expressing grief over her three-year-old child not being able to participate in warfare.

The TV comedian, screenwriter, and producer had relocated to Israel before his designation.

The foreign agents law, enacted in late 2012, allows for the identification of Russian individuals and nonprofit organizations engaged in political activities and receiving funding from abroad.

Although it does not impose civil or criminal penalties, unlike its U.S. counterpart that served as its model, those labeled as foreign agents are burdened with demanding reporting obligations.

 INCREDIBLE footage shows a panicked Russian pilot ejecting from his plane and watching as it crashes in a fireball after being shot down.

The explosion could be seen miles away after the jet was taken down by what is thought to be Ukrainian fire.

The fighter pilot had to release his parachute mid-air and was forced to land in an abandoned field.

The shocking first-person footage is believed to have been recorded in the summer but wasn't released until now.

It shows the Russian fighter pilot release his parachute mid-air after his Su-25SM was taken down by what's believed to have been incoming Ukrainian fire, according to a weapons tracking account on Twitter.

The aircraft nose-dives into the ground, unleashing a hellish explosion that can be seen from miles away while the pilot lands safety in an abandoned field.

It is unclear what happened to the pilot since the recording but some observers claim the flight crashed during a planned training run in Belgorod region, Russia.

It comes as astonishing footage shows the moment a Ukrainian tank opened fire in a vicious battle against Russian forces.

Fierce fighting can be seen in the video as the 46-tonne T-84 main battle tank blasts its 125mm cannon towards Putin's men during the bloody clash that is understood to have occurred near Kherson.

Ukrainian forces are seen engaging nearly point-blank with a Russian convoy who appear to have blundered into them as they drove up a dirt road.

Trucks emblazoned with the ""Z"" symbol can see attempting to rush past the tank - only for soldiers on the ground to then open fire on them.

The bearded gunner in the tank's turret ducks down as gunfire can be heard all around him.

With the snaps of bullets and the boom of tank guns, the convoy - with a truck towing a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier - grind to a halt.

Other clips released as part of the video package shows the gunner opening fire on unseen foes with his heavy machine gun.

It's believed Mad Vlad would happily sacrifice 20 million soldiers to ensure he won the war in Ukraine and secure his future as Russia's leader, a former insider has claimed.

The chilling warning comes as fears of the war in Ukraine turning nuclear continue to grow as Russia's defence minister said a ""dirty bomb"" could be detonated in Ukraine.

Exiled former diplomat Boris Bondarev warned Putin would sacrifice millions of lives to win in Ukraine.

""He is not smart, he is just lucky. Now I think his luck is over,"" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.

""You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.

""It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.""

Bondarev added: ""After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.

""And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.""

Meanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking ""uncontrolled escalation"" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.

Shoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a ""dirty bomb"" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.

And while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.

But it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.

Putin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.

The leftist president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has come under fire from certain Ukrainian sympathisers for his opposition to European arm supplies to Kyiv. The Mexican administration has stated its desire to maintain neutrality in the crisis.

Nevertheless, Mexico has cast a vote on a number of significant UN resolutions with the United States and other Western nations.

According to the sources, the address was scheduled to start Thursday at about noon.

Zelenskyy’s address to the lower house of Congress came at the invitation of a congressional friendship group between Mexico and Ukraine, according to the sources. There are other similar groups in the Mexican Congress, including one for Russia.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The German president and the US ambassador to Mexico have been among the diplomatic allies that have sought to persuade the Mexican government to side with Ukraine against Russia.

Attempts to sway public opinion in Mexico over the war in Ukraine have led to some notable spats in Congress.

Last year, the Russian ambassador to Mexico told Mexican lawmakers that Mexico would never take orders from “Uncle Sam”, prompting the US ambassador to urge Mexico to support Ukraine.

Lopez Obrador last year proposed a plan to halt the fighting in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials opposed it, arguing it would be advantageous to Russia.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard met separately with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to discuss the peace plan at the UN General Assembly in September. Nothing has come of the plan so far.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is currently on a Latin American tour, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

Though Western ‘news’ media have gotten their ‘explanation’ of this event from Ukraine’s Government, it never made sense that Russia would have wanted to flood, harm, and weaken, the entire western half of the territory that Russia now controls in the former Ukraine, including in Crimea (which was getting its water-supply from that dam).

The anonymous author of the “Moon of Alabama” website has a long and almost flawless record of accurately exposing realities that mainstream U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media had been hiding, and the latest such is his June 13th “Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam?” His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia. U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

First, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.

The British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.

The present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.

Ever since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,

“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.

“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”

Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …

Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.

Even U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian “spin.”

So: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it. And, now, an extremely likely explanation has finally been provided, which implicates both Ukraine’s government and UK’s Government as having done it."

 Energy giant Centrica is prepared to do the right thing, small beer though it looks

Hope on bills

AT last one energy giant is prepared to do the right thing, small beer though it looks.

Centrica’s grants of £250 to £750 for customers least able to pay their monstrous new gas bills are welcome.

But they still won’t make much of a dent.

No surprise there when the firm is donating only ten per cent of the profits from its British Gas arm.

That’s a negligible fraction of Centrica’s soaring total: £1.34billion in just six months this year.

It can do so much more.

But at least it is doing something.

More than can be said of Shell and BP, making scandalously vast war profits since Putin strangled the oil supply.

Those who still oppose the windfall tax in these truly exceptional circumstances should think again.

WHY should Russians be free to holiday in Britain, or Italy, or the South of France?

We and the EU should ban new visas now.

No, it’s not fair on those opposed to Putin.

But many of them fled Russia months or years ago.

Depressing surveys show huge support among the remaining population for Putin’s genocide.

It is delusional to imagine those are all inaccurate.

Ordinary Russians seem mostly behind wiping Ukraine and its people off the map.

Our Defence Secretary Ben Wallace wants only to tighten visa rules to bar the families of oligarchs and Kremlin goons.

But we should go further, as Ukraine’s President Zelensky says.

Russians who can prove they have publicly opposed Putin can request asylum.

The rest must know they are not welcome to travel to Europe while their country is still butchering its neighbour.

We must do everything we can to turn them against their murderous dictator.

BRITAIN is being suffocated by a culture of obstructionism which stops anything getting done while simultaneously seeking to regulate our lives and crush pleasure.

The Lib Dems are shamefully proud to champion all campaigners against progress.

Similarly, in Whitehall, their left-liberal civil service soulmates enjoy thwarting any radical ideas for change.

Meanwhile the same group obsessively plot to dictate what ordinary people can eat and drink — and even whether to allow us a harmless flutter.

 Three days after Jamie Dimon sparked a marketwide selloff that sent stocks to fresh 2022 lows after he predicted a US recession in “6 to 9” months citing drivers including rising interest rates, persistent inflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and warned stocks could drop another 20%, the JPMorgan CEO who is expected to report earnings tomorrow (and hopefully clarify why his bank refuses to move its deposit rate above 0.01% in the process keeping $2.2 trillion in liquidity locked inside the overnight funding facility), doubled down today saying the Fed can’t cool the red-hot economy without bringing on a recession. [bold, links added]

…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”

He also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”

Echoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.

And he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”

Finally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.

Fundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…

Jamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.

We wouldn’t have to pay higher prices to gas up our cars and lawnmowers if Biden the Bumbler Had’d canceled the Keystone Pipeline and the ANWR to appease the Eco-Freaks and the Russians/OPEC"

 Warning US hospitals are ‘most vulnerable to cyber attack that will be more devastating than 9/11’ in wake of Covid

AMERICAN hospitals are most vulnerable to a cyberattack that would be more devastating than the September 11 terror attacks, an expert fears.

Professor Scheherazade Rehman, director of the European Union Research Center (EURC), warned that the healthcare sector has been ""exacerbated"" by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Rehman said financial institutions have upgraded their cyber defenses over the past decade - unlike healthcare.

She told The Sun: ""We don't have anything that the banks are doing in healthcare settings from hospitals to healthcare delivery centers.

""If your card has been hacked, the bank can lock it down and switch the number.

“But you cannot change your blood type, you can’t change if you’ve had cancer, you can’t change your date of birth or your DNA. Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.

“Simply changing someone’s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.”

The expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be “more crippling” than a terrorist attack.

She added: “9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.

“But, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.”

In June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a “critical condition”.

The dossier stated: “Healthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.”

Researchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.

This compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.

'EASY TARGETS'

And, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that’s easy to breach, according to Wired.

Analysts at the Brookings Institute believe “the fate of healthcare security” depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.

They said: “Just as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients’ underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.""

Fears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.

Department of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on “heightened alert” for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.

Rehman believes an attack on the US is ""highly likely"" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.

Pentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a ""horrific"" aftermath.

Moscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.

Rehman said: “A US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world’s first large-scale cyberwar.

US IN 'WARFARE STATE'

“The Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations – meaning they’re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they’re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.”

R.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a “warfare state” with Moscow, Fox News reports.

He told governors: “What’s Russia’s next move? [It’s] very likely is to increase cyberattacks. It’s an easy move for them.

“We are already in a warfare state right now and we need to be aware of that.”

RUSSIA LATEST

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

 The president of Russia said on Friday the United States and its NATO allies have ignored Moscow’s security demands, while a top Kremlin official said Russia does not want a war.

“There won’t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don’t want a war,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an interview with local radio stations. “But we won’t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.”

During the call, Putin said he wants to continue dialogue with the West to negotiate a stalled peace agreement for eastern Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany. Presidential envoys from the four countries already met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to another meeting in Berlin in two weeks.

The latest diplomatic move also comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday called on the West not to create “panic,” challenging U.S. warnings about an imminent Russian attack.

“I don’t consider the situation now tenser than before. There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That’s not the case,” Zelensky told reporters at a Friday press briefing. “We don’t need this panic,” he added.

Zelensky’s comment comes one day after rumors spread that President Joe Biden warned him during a phone call that Kyiv would soon be “sacked” in an invasion by Russian military forces.

“He has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false,” she said.

Meanwhile, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko also ruled out that there will be war, saying there will not be a war unless Belarus or Russia comes under attack.

“The leaders of some countries have gone mad, they think they can win that war,” Lukashenko said. “But there will be no victory, we will all lose.”

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine—which amounts to about 130,000—is comparable to Moscow’s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises.

“We haven’t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,” with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.

While Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the United States ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.

Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops have also headed to Belarus for sweeping joint drills, again raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north."

 KYIV—Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s western region of Lviv with missiles early on March 24, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace, according to Warsaw.

Moscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said.

“There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,” Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility.

The energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.

Air defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.

There were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.

The energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.

Several explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.

There was only minor damage from the attack, he said.

Small groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.

Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.

The wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.

“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.

Polish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.

“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”

Poland’s army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told reporters that the missile travelled about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.

There was no immediate comment from Russia. Warsaw said it would demand an explanation from Moscow.

Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side."

 VLADIMIR Putin was spotted with a mystery ""prominent scar"" on his neck that has led to swirling rumours the despot is amid a ""thyroid cancer battle"".

Intrigue over the Russian leader's health resurfaced following photos that were snapped at an Orthodox Easter cathedral service in Moscow at the weekend.

Images showed stone-faced Putin clasping a candle as the church proceedings went on.

However, most strikingly was an evident ""scar"" on his neck.

It prompted a debate online about whether the new snaps stack up the claims made by Proekt media, who have said Putin is suffering from thyroid cancer.

The independent outlet spearheaded an investigation that revealed the dictator was constantly accompanied by a team of surgeons.

READ MORE ON VLADIMIR PUTIN

One in particular, Yevgeny Selivanov, who specialises in thyroid cancer.

The scar appears as a prominent diagonal line upwards from left to right on his neck.

It was clearly seen in the pictures posted by the Kremlin from the Easter service.

Telegram channel, Unian, claimed the scar was the shape of a letter 'Z', a pro-war symbol used by Putin’s invading forces.

Most read in The Sun

An Unian spokesman said: ""A strange scar in the shape of the letter 'Z' has been noticed on Putin's neck.

""The unusual shots were taken on Easter when the dictator visited a cathedral.""

Denis Kazaksky, a Ukrainian blogger, also pointed to the ""prominent scar"" in one of his social media videos.

He said: ""What is it with Volodya [Putin]?

""I think I have figured out where the 'Z' came from.""

It is not the first time Putin's apparent scar has come to light.

In December 2020, Russian media outlet Sobesednik identified a distinct marking on his neck.

At the time, plastic surgeon Amjad Al-Yousef said: ""In theory, after intubation such a scar can remain, but this is only in theory.

""It often happens that not even a scar remains as the skin heals.""

He was speaking before suspicious claims emerged that Putin suffered from thyroid cancer.

However, there is no evidence the despot leader has ever undergone surgery for removal of the thyroid gland.

Al-Yousef claimed it could possibly not be a scar but a mark in his loose skin - common in an ""elderly person"".

Conversely in 2020, the marking did not appear as prominent as seen in recent days at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow.

Al-Yousef suggested Putin, 70, had undergone regular plastic surgery on his face - but this was not done on his neck.

He said: ""No plastic surgery is performed on this part of the body.

""Even if we assume that this is some kind of innovation in plastic surgery, then in this case it would have been performed more professionally without such a serious mistake.""

Pointing to a photo of Putin from 2020, Al-Yousef clarified the differences in appearance.

He said: ""Here is the classic neck of a 68 year old man with low skin strength.

“With age, skin turgor changes and becomes weaker.

""Vladimir Putin’s face is very well-groomed, professional cosmetic care is noticeable.

""And when we see the perfect face, we naturally begin to pay attention to the skin of the neck.

""Unfortunately, there are no such effective professional treatments for the neck.

""While putting a shirt and a tie on, the throat is squeezed, the skin gathers and turns into such a fold.""

The Proekt investigative report claimed one medic Alexey Shcheglov ""relentlessly"" followed the Russian leader and had made 59 trips encompassing 282 days by his side.

According to the report, Shcheglov was seen as a medic ""who, among other things, can be the first to detect problems with the thyroid gland, including oncological ones.""

Putin was also under the attention of Igor Esakov, an ENT specialist, who made 38 trips to Putin, covering 152 days.

He was also accompanied by Yevgeny Selivanov, a cancer surgeon - during 35 trips, it was reported.

His expertise covers ""peculiarities of diagnostics and surgical treatment of elderly and senile patients with thyroid cancer.""

Multiple other medics were revealed as caring for the Russian president.

Separate claims have suggested Putin was undergoing chemotherapy.

One political analyst claimed the warmonger was ""high on speed"" to get through key meetings as he struggles with health issues.

 WALL Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has had his latest appeal blocked by a judge in Moscow after he was locked up on bogus spy charges.

The 31-year-old American appeared in a glass-walled dock after being brought from the tough jail where he has been held since March.

He lodged an appeal against a Moscow court judge's earlier decision to extend his pretrial detention into late November.

But today, the judge refused to hear the case and instead sent it to a lower court because of ""procedural violations"".

Russian officials have not yet provided any public evidence to back up their allegations.

No date has been officially set for his trial, however Putin's spooks continue to extend his detention - which today reached 174 days.

He will now suffer behind bars in the notorious Lefortovo prison until at least November 30.

Most read in The Sun

The WSJ's Moscow correspondent's pretrial detention was originally supposed to expire on May 29 - but appeals for his release have been repeatedly denied.

This expiration was pushed back to August 30, and was then extended into late November.

He has failed in two previous appeals, in April and June.

Under Moscow's criminal law, the 31-year-old could face a pretrial extension of up to 12 months.

Putin's arrest of Evan has previously been branded internationally as a ""cowardly act"" as the despot desperately tries to escape accountability over his war in Ukraine.

His arrest marked an increasingly ferocious crackdown on media freedom in Russia.

It is the first time Russia has brought a spy case against an overseas journalist since the end of the Cold War, and he faces a jail term of up to 20 years if convicted.

His employers called the arrest ""a vicious affront to a free press"" that ""should spur outrage in all free people and governments throughout the world"".

“No reporter should ever be detained for simply doing their job,"" The Journal added.

Washington has repeatedly stated that charges against Gershkovich are bogus and baseless and has demanded his immediate release.

They have deplored his ""wrongful detention"" as a method of ""hostage diplomacy"" designed to give Russia leverage at the bargaining table at a time when relations between the two countries have plunged to their lowest point in more than 60 years.

US officials said in July that there was still no clear ""pathway"" to getting him home, despite high-level talks.

EN_UA_103667.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions 

 For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.

The dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Since then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.

After a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.

Sanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.

Similarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.

Before the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.

Both sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.

During their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.

Rocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.

From Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).

The MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.

The study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.

The hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.

SPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.

Experts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.

Additionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.

In 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.

Moreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Military commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.

“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.

Independent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.

“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.

“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”"

 Zelensky Exposed: Former Advisor Reveals How Ukrainian President Thinks He's Omnipotent

Authored by Grzegorz Adamczyk via Remix News,

The arrogance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is causing problems with Kyiv’s allies and he believes that, as his country is at war, he can do anything, his former adviser has claimed.

In a bombshell interview with Polish news outlet dorzeczy.pl, Oleksyi Arestovych slammed his former boss for his increasingly overbearing behavior and believes he has fallen victim to delusions of grandeur and a belief that he is all-powerful.

Arestovych cited Zelensky’s response to the ongoing diplomatic conflict over the dumping of Ukrainian grain as an example, accusing the president’s office of “behaving as if it has a decisive voice in the European Union rather than being a country aspiring to join the bloc.”

The former adviser, who himself is a possible candidate in any future Ukrainian presidential election, expressed his fear that Zelensky “has become deluded into thinking he now rules the globe.”

His diplomacy concentrates on making demands and using moral blackmail to claim Ukraine is fighting for the West, said Arestovych, who claimed this tactic may have been successful at the beginning of the conflict but is no longer effective.

“The West is increasingly irritated by Ukraine’s arrogance,” he added.

Arestovych claimed that Zelensky’s behavior had led to tension among Kyiv’s closest allies including Poland and Romania, while its relations with the U.S. and the U.K. have also cooled.

The West will continue to support Ukraine because it is in the West’s own interests to do so, but it may well stop supporting the current Ukrainian government and back an alternative, he warned.

However, Arestovych was dismissive of the argument that Ukraine was colluding with Germany against Poland, claiming that this is only purely due to the fact that Ukraine has no clear foreign policy under Zelensky.

Ukraine wants Germany to be a counter-balance to Russia and that is why Ukraine backs its ambitions of securing a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, the former advisor told the Polish news outlet.

Arestovych admitted that Poland could have gotten more out of Ukraine on issues related to the Volhynia massacre by pursuing a more transactional policy towards the country, but that would not have been beneficial to it in the longer term. “Even if Zelensky is ungrateful for all the help selflessly offered by Poland, Ukrainian people are grateful and that will be more important in the longer term,” he assured.

 by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:

The world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.

These “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

There has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”

Last year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.

China is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.

Ukraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.

On October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.

As Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?

To further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.

To retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.

As the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”

It is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”

Biden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.

Not content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.

As the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.

 Moscow court rejects Evan Gershkovich’s appeal, keeping him in jail until at least June 30

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will remain jailed on espionage charges until at least late June, after a Moscow court Tuesday rejected his appeal that sought to end his pretrial detention.

The 32-year-old U.S. citizen was detained in late March 2023 while on a reporting trip and has spent more than a year in jail, with authorities routinely extending his time behind bars and rejecting his appeals. Last month, his pretrial detention was continued yet again — until June 30 — in a ruling that he and his lawyers challenged. A Moscow appellate court rejected the appeal Tuesday.

In the courtroom on Tuesday, Gershkovich, wearing a white T-shirt and an open checked shirt, looked relaxed, at times laughing and chatting with members of his legal team.

His arrest in the city of Yekaterinburg rattled journalists in Russia, where authorities have not detailed what, if any, evidence they have to support the espionage charges.

U.S. journalist marks a year in a Russian prison as courts keep extending his time behind bars

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich marks a year behind bars Friday following his arrest by Russian authorities who accuse him of espionage.

Gershkovich and his employer have denied the allegations, and the U.S. government has declared him to be wrongfully detained.

Analysts have pointed out that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips in U.S.-Russian tensions over the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. At least two U.S. citizens arrested in Russia in recent years — including WNBA star Brittney Griner — have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the United States.

In December, the U.S. State Department said it had made a significant offer to secure the release ofGershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, that it said Moscow had rejected.

Officials did not describe the offer, although Russia has been said to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, who was given a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing in Berlin of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.

A Russian court extends the pretrial detention for American reporter accused of spying

A court in Moscow ruled to keep Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in custody pending his trial on espionage charges.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, asked this year about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for “liquidating a bandit” who had allegedly killed Russian soldiers during separatist fighting in Chechnya.

Beyond that hint, Russian officials have kept mum about the talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeatedly said that while “certain contacts” on swaps continue, “they must be carried out in absolute silence.”

Gershkovich is the first U.S. reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges."

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Russia is preparing for a war with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the West. The preparations are for a “long-term confrontation”.

A growing number of Western rulers have also warned of a military threat from Russia to countries along the eastern flank of NATO, calling for Europe to get prepared by rearming.

The chief of the intelligence service said the assessment was based on Russian plans to double the number of forces stationed along its border with NATO members Finland and the Baltic States of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. “Russia has chosen a path which is a long-term confrontation … and the Kremlin is probably anticipating a possible conflict with NATO within the next decade or so,” Kaupo Rosin told reporters at the release of Estonia’s national security threats report, according to a report by The New York Post.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Rosin claimed that a military attack by Russia is “highly unlikely” in the short term, partly because Russia has to keep troops in Ukraine, and that would be unlikely if the Russian buildup of forces was matched in Europe. “If we are not prepared, the likelihood (of a military Russian attack) would be much higher than without any preparation,” Rosin added.

Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries.

Germany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War Two, and Rosin said NATO and its allies were moving in the right direction to counter the Russian threat. –The New York Post.

Russia has repeatedly warned that it will go to war with NATO if the West’s weapons defeat Russia, or lethal aid is sent to Ukraine. One could argue that the West has crossed that line, but Russia has yet to follow through with an attack on NATO.

 U.S., Europe plan for any cutoff of Russian natural gas over Ukraine crisis

U.S. and European officials are coordinating with natural gas suppliers around the globe to cushion the impact if Russia were to cut off energy supplies in the conflict over Ukraine, Biden administration officials say.

The U.S. and its European allies have promised punishing economic and political sanctions if Russia moves its military into Ukraine, but worry about repercussions for Europeans from any such sanctions, including Russia potentially cutting off delivery of its natural gas to Europe at the height of winter.

Putin has deployed roughly 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border for weeks, sparking a diplomatic crisis for Europe and the United States. He denies any intention of invasion.

Any U.S. and European measures against Russia in the event of an invasion “also have consequences for others, including us,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in remarks as part of a lecture series Monday night.

“There’s a cost imposed on everyone,” Blinken said. “But we have done a tremendous amount of work to mitigate any effects of sanctions on those ... imposing them, as well as any retaliatory action that Russia might take.”

Two senior U.S. administration officials separately briefed reporters Tuesday about efforts by Biden’s national security team to deal with any knock-on effects from sanctions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

Western embassies are also moving some of their staff out of Kyiv

If needed, Europe would look to natural gas supplies in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. The effort would require “rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources” to make up for a Russian cutoff, according to one of the officials.

The Biden administration has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin has high tolerance for the damage to Russia’s economy that would come with sanctions. But officials said the “start high, stay high” approach to penalties that they have told Moscow they would take could influence Putin’s calculations.

One official said sanctions could spur inflation in Russia “in the mid-teens” and even, according to the second official, a deep recession that would not help Putin “win hearts and minds” among his compatriots.

In the U.S., a group representing large industrial energy users and manufacturers that oppose export of U.S. natural gas appeared open to considering an exception for helping Europeans weather any possible cutoff of Russian natural gas.

Ukraine’s leaders are seeking to reassure their jittery citizens that an invasion from neighboring Russia is not imminent, despite a troop buildup.

The group, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, has asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to limit exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Surging U.S. exports have helped drive up natural gas prices, the group argues.

Paul Cicio, the group’s president, told reporters on Tuesday that his group had not taken a position on how the U.S. should respond to tensions between Russia and Europe over natural gas.

“My own personal view is that if Europe needs gas, the U.S. should be there to supply our allies,″ Cicio said, noting that China is the top recipient of U.S. gas exports.

“Do we have capacity to supply our allies? Absolutely,″ Cicio said. “But maybe we don’t have capacity to ship to China. So we need to be sensitive to the political crisis. It’s a real serious thing.”"

 How Putin has amassed a staggering SIX THOUSAND nuclear weapons that could reach UK in 20 minutes

AS sabre rattling goes, it takes some beating.

Vladimir Putin’s thinly-veiled threat to nuke the West and insistence that he is ""not bluffing"" has caused panic across the world.

Since the Cold War started, it has been assumed the threat of “mutually assured destruction” — in which tit-for-tat strikes would destroy both parties — would prevent a nuclear war.

However, in a chilling threat this week, the unhinged Russian leader declared: ""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will use all the means at our disposal to defend Russia and our people, this is not a bluff.""

With the dictator’s invasion of Ukraine meeting far stiffer resistance than expected and Western governments uniting against it, such desperate — and terrifying — measures appear more likely.

When Putin announced his invasion, he warned the West that it would face “consequences never encountered in your history” if Nato was to interfere militarily.

So, could the nightmare come true? Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.

At his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.

They include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.

They have never been used in combat — so far.

Most read in The Sun

Russia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.

They include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.

Unleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.

But he may not care about retaliation.

The Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.

He said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.

“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”

This, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.

Sam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.

“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”

Nato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.

Pavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”

And US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.

'CONCERNING'

Many wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.

But one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”

However, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine” (commonly used in U.S.-and-allied official Government statements).

“unprovoked war in Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

“Russian aggression against Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

Any alleged report that employs any such phrase is propaganda — lying ‘news’ or ‘history’ — that bases itself upon the false unstated assumption that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 started the war in Ukraine, instead of responded to a war in Ukraine that U.S. President Barack Obama’s Administration (including Joe Biden) — the American Government — had actually started there, in 2014, against Ukraine’s adjoining nation of Russia. America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).

Here, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:

The Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.

For the full details, see this.

So: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).

The war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).

America’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.

What is the power of lies?

In a U.N. General Assembly vote on November 14th, the U.N. General Assembly (which has no power) voted by 94 votes for, 73 abstentions, and only 14 votes against, a Resolution to demand that Russia pay restitution to Ukraine, for the war in Ukraine — that America started against Russia by its 2014 coup."

In his view, this is just the latest directive that will result in hundreds of thousands of euros being siphoned off by Brussels from the pockets of Polish and European citizens. The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.

„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”

With the help of left-wing politicians in Poland, the European Parliament’s liberal majority has voted in favour of a proposal which would make everyone living in a family house today pay tens of thousands of euros out of their own pocket to implement a policy that will result in some economies growing, while others are being sidelined. The vice president of the Law and Justice Party explained that no European funding had been provided to implement the directive.

 Reporter who helped reveal assassination plot on Putin opposition figure Navalny ‘BANNED’ from BAFTAs

A REPORTER who helped to reveal the plot to murder Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has been ""banned"" from attending this weekend's BAFTAs.

Christo Grozev features in the 2022 film Navalny, which has been nominated for Best Documentary at the awards ceremony.

The film follows the story of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's poisoning in 2020 - and the subsequent efforts of Grozev and fellow investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh revealing the plot to kill the Russian opposition politician.

Navalny, one of Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, survived the attempt on his life with a deadly nerve agent.

He is currently serving sentences totalling eleven-and-a-half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court.

Taken aback by the ruling, Grozev took to Twitter on Friday to inform his followers.

He said: ""I was surprised to discover that my whole family and I have all been banned by British police from attending this weekend's Bafta awards where the documentary #Navalny is nominated.

""The reason stated: 'We represent a public security risk'.

""I understand the need to keep the public safe (although I don't understand how my son or teenage daughter constitute risk to the public). But moments like this show the growing dangers to independent journalists around the world.

""These dangers don't stem just from murderous dictators, but also from having journalists' voices hushed - instead of amplified - by the civilised world they are trying to serve.""

In response to Grozev's online remarks, Met Police said that police forces generally ""do not and cannot"" ban individuals from attending events, and the decision will rest with the show's organisers.

Despite hand-wringing about ""hostile intentions of foreign states"" in the UK, Met Police said it could not comment on an individual's safety.

A statement read: ""We cannot comment on the safety of an individual or the advice they may have been given.

""However, the situation that journalists face around the world and the fact that some journalists face the hostile intentions of foreign states whilst in the UK is a reality that we are absolutely concerned with.

""We are committed to working with our intelligence partners to investigate these threats and to take other steps to ensure the safety of those concerned.""

The Met added: ""Despite our efforts, on protective security and on investigations, we recognise the impact of those threats on those affected.

""The responsibility for such threats and their potential impact on the wider public lies with the hostile state actors behind them and we have significantly increased the resources applied to bearing down on those.

""More generally, police do not and cannot ban anyone from attending a private event. Decisions about the attendance at an event is a matter for the event organisers.

""We recognise that our advice can mean organisers have difficult choices to make when deciding how best to mitigate any risks to the security of their event, and we are grateful for the ongoing engagement of Bafta.""

Christo Grozev is the lead Russia investigator for investigative group Bellingcat.

The Netherlands-based outfit's work focuses on “security threats, extraterritorial clandestine operations, and the weaponization of information,” according to their website.

Responding to Grozev's Twitter thread, Tory MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Alicia Kearns responded: ""I've raised with ministers - you are not the security risk.""

In a statement given to the PA news agency regarding security at Sunday's ceremony, Bafta said: ""The safety of all our guests and staff at the ceremony is always our highest priority, and we have robust and appropriate security arrangements in place every year.""

Bafta also confirmed that the film's producers Diane Becker, Shane Boris, Melanie Miller and Odessa Rae will be in attendance as nominees for Navalny.

 THIS is the horrifying moment Russia appeared to unleash flesh-melting ""thermite bombs"" on a Ukrainian town.

Terrifying footage shows the night sky in Marinka lit up by a chilling rain of sparkling, burning thermite - a killer chemical mixture.

The video, taken through a smashed window by someone sheltering inside a building, shows a huge area of the town in the Donetsk region being showered with the horror bombs.

Ukrainian journalists shared the video on Twitter - describing it as the ""scariest footage of thermite shelling"" they had ever seen.

Marinka is on the frontline of Putin's war in Ukraine as Moscow tries to gain control of the Donbas region - made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.

Thermite, a mixture of metal powder and metal oxide, is used in the making of incendiary bombs.

It burns at temperatures of more than 2,400C - being so hot it can burn through steel and concrete.

And if it comes into contact with human flesh, it can melt through right down to the bone.

Human Rights Watch previously warned the deadly weapon can cause extremely painful burns on the human skin and can lead to respiratory problems.

The bombs use is significantly dangerous as their wide area of range means they cannot be contained on the battlefield - and its effects could hit civilians.

Most read in News

The killer weapons were used during the Second World War.

The use of thermite as an incendiary weapon is nowadays considered a war crime.

Its use was banned by the third protocol of the 1980 UN Convention on Conventional Weapons in Geneva.

Russia was previously accused of using phosphorus bombs in its effort to take over the Mariupol steel plant Azovstal in May this year.

Dramatic footage showed a Russian missile detonating mid-air above the plant with flaming explosives dropping down.

Ukrainian officials claimed the clip showed Russian forces dropping 9M22S incendiary and phosphorus bombs on the steelworks.

Russia was also accused of using the killer weapons after footage emerged allegedly showing white phosphorous burning fiercely on the ground in the eastern city of Kramatorsk.

 Russia ‘could split off from global internet’ – and US fears that Russian web could look like China’s Great Firewall

RUSSIA could split off from the global internet as the Kremlin cracks down on the web, officials fear.

As real war rages in Ukraine, Russia has is pushing ahead with an intense information war online.

A key battleground in the Kremlin's online crackdown is the Russian internet.

Several businesses have shut down their online and physical operations in Russia.

Meanwhile, Kremlin officials led by President Vladimir Putin have blocked access to some of the platforms that have not halted service in Russia.

Instagram, which is three times as popular as Facebook in Russia, was blocked by state officials.

The Kremlin’s plans to isolate Russia from the global internet predate the invasion of Ukraine.

In 2019, Russia passed the Sovereign Internet Law which redirects traffic through Russian servers – allowing a watchful Kremlin to censor the web.

In 2021, the Russian government labeled the internet a national security threat.

This month, Russia’s deputy digital minister Andrei Chernenko directed Russian websites to switch to domain name system (DNS) servers that are within Russia’s borders.

Most read in Tech

In doing so, internet operations in Russia are dependent on hardware within the country which strengthens the state’s ability to control content.

Russian citizens can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass Russia’s rigid internet restrictions.

A VPN shields your IP address, hides your physical location and scrambles the record of your internet history.

But with Visa, Mastercard and American Express suspending operations in Russia, many citizens have no way to pay for web tools to help them evade Russian censorship policies.

Kremlin crackdown

The Russians' work to domesticate the internet is not unlike the Chinese Great Firewall internet policy.

China governs the internet with intense scrutiny and has loads of restrictions against international websites.

The Chinese government has ownership over internet channels and lends access to people and businesses.

Chinese internet users rarely explore web pages that are based or created outside of China.

FreedomHouse, a nonprofit focused on analyzing the strength of freedom across the world, ranked the Chinese internet as one of the least free in the world with a score of 10/100.

The United States, for comparison, has an internet freedom score of 75/100.

In fracturing the internet, China and Russia leave citizens just with state-approved networks as their only source of information.

""They want the ability to move to not one big global network but different networks where you can surveil your citizens more easily,” Karen Kornbluh, an expert on US-European diplomacy, told NBC News.

“In the longer term, Russia wants to be able to cut off access to Signal,” Kornbluh said.

Signal is a secure messaging app used by journalists to avoid government snooping – and it's now the fastest growing app in Russia.

RT, one of Russia’s state-controlled media networks, has pushed false justifications for the invasion of Ukraine and has come under fire for other propagandist tendencies.

 A Former Ukrainian MP Blew The Whistle On Burisma's Connections To Terrorism

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Former Ukrainian MP Andrey Derkach, who’s reviled by the Biden Administration for sharing dirt about Hunter Biden’s Burisma corruption scandal with Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani ahead of the 2020 elections, just gave a very important interview to Belarus’ BelTA where be blew the whistle even louder. According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.

Derkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.

On the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.

About that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.

That’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.

In his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”

Looking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.

Altogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.

The dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it."

 VLADIMIR Putin has honoured an army unit accused of war crimes and genocide in the Russian town of Bucha, reports suggest.

A decree signed by the Russian tyrant gave the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the title of guards – scandalously praising them for ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage.""

Earlier this month, the Ukrainian ministry identified the unit as those responsible for the alleged rape and murder of innocent Ukrainians.

The barbarous pack, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - dubbed the “Butcher of Bucha” - left a trail of death and destruction in their wake.

Harrowing pictures from the city, to the north-west of the capital Kyiv, showed the bodies of civilians scattered in the road and in shallow graves — many with bound hands and signs of torture.

Some of them, from the wounds they had suffered, had been shot from close range.

Women and children were also found by Ukrainian soldiers, having been raped and then murdered.

The barbaric troops are believed to have conducted the Bucha slaughter as they scarpered from Kyiv after their botched attempt to take the Ukrainian capital.

Days later, Ukrainian intelligence suggested the troops were being redeployed in Belgorod in Western Russia amid claims that Russian commanders were refusing to rotate their brigades.

The country’s defence ministry claimed troops were being sent to the ""hottest spots"" in the hope they will be slaughtered by Ukrainian fighters before they can testify before a war crime tribunal.

The Kremlin has continued to deny accusations its troops committed war crimes in Ukraine after suggesting chilling pictures of dead bodies strewn across Kyiv streets were staged by Ukraine and the West.

Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky was visibly emotional as he visited the site just days after the mass graves were discovered.

The Ukrainian leader was flanked by security as he vowed to ensure that the “war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers on his country’s soil were “the last such evil on Earth”.

Boris Johnson later described the events as not “far short of genocide” as the EU's Ursula von der Leyen was later seen visiting the scene of the massacre.

It comes as the number of heads of state and former prime ministers backing calls for an international tribunal over Ukraine continues to rise amid widespread international condemnation of the events unfolding in Eastern Europe.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared to overhaul the country's economy for a protracted war in Ukraine, The Hill reported Friday.

After reshuffling his cabinet, replacing Sergei Shoigu with economist Andrei Belousov as Moscow's defense chief, and the ousted Nikolai Patrushev with Shoigu as secretary of Russia's security council, the moves have spurred speculation that Putin is consolidating power, according to the report.

""Taken together, the shake-up promotes economic over military minds to sustain"" Putin's ""war machine across several years, as well as stamping out any threat of a possible usurper,"" one expert told The Hill.

These changes indicate that Putin is ""digging in for the long term"" on Ukraine, Mark Galeotti, the head of Mayak Intelligence consultancy, said.

""Essentially, this is pointing to a strategy of attrition and a willingness to take risks, take losses, while waiting for Ukraine to no longer have the capacity to fight and the West no longer the will to keep supporting it,"" Galeotti told The Hill.

“Putin has brought this delegation of both cabinet members and the heads of Russian banks and energy companies — and shaken up his cabinet just before his visit to the economic patron of his war in Ukraine, the Chinese Communist Party,” Jonathan Ward, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, told The Hill."

Ukraine President Zelenskyy announced last week that 16,000 foreign fighters have been recruited to serve in Ukraine’s Foreign Legion, however given recent events it appears the foreign fighters may represent a liability rather than an asset for Ukraine.

 A report from Italy claims that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has rejected Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s efforts to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament.

Meloni is currently serving as leader of the group, which is made up of a wide range of conservative and center-right parties across Europe. However, according to Italian press outlet Corriere della Sera, Meloni sees more disadvantages than advantages to Orbán joining the group.

One of the main sticking points is Orbán’s pro-peace position on the war in Ukraine. He remains opposed to sending weapons to Ukraine and is calling for an immediate ceasefire; in contrast, Meloni is pushing for more weapons and continued war against Russia, which has made her somewhat of a darling of the Brussels elite, who see her as someone they can work with, including on the issue of migration.

Meloni herself has taken a notable U-turn on the issue of migration, calling for more legal migration to Italy and overseeing a huge increase in illegal migration under her rule.

Meloni is looking to grow the ECR from the sixth-largest grouping in the EU parliament to the third largest. Among the parties belonging to the group are Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS), who have also shunned Orbán’s views on the war in Ukraine. The stance of other parties may have also played a role in Meloni’s decision to exclude Orbán from the group.

It is unclear how Orbán and his Fidesz party will react to Meloni’s rejection. So far, only Corriere della Sera has reported on the issue, but there has been no denial from either camp over the issue.

The Biden-Schumer Plan To Kill More Ukrainians

President Joe Biden is refusing to fold a losing hand as he bets with Ukrainian lives and U.S. taxpayer money. Biden and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer propose to squander the lives of tens of thousands more Ukrainians and $61 billions of federal funds to keep Biden's disastrous foreign policy failure hidden from view until after the November election.

The $61 billion will make no difference on the battlefield except to prolong the war, the tens of thousands of deaths, and the physical destruction of Ukraine. It will not ""save"" Ukraine. Ukraine's security can only be achieved at the negotiating table, not by some fantasized military triumph over Russia.

$61 billion is not nothing. This worse-than-useless outlay would exceed the combined budgets of the U.S. Department of Labor, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and the Women, Infant, and Children nutrition program.

Almost exactly 10 years ago this month, Biden did much to put Ukraine on the path to disaster. This is well known to those who have looked carefully at the facts but is kept hidden from view by the White House, the Senate Democrats, and the mainstream media that back Biden. I have previously provided a detailed chronology, with hyperlinks, here.

In 1990, President George H. W. Bush, Sr. and his German counterpart Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand eastward if the Soviet Union accepted German reunification. When the Soviet Union disbanded in December 1991, with Russia as the successor state, American leaders decided to renege."

 The leading general of the British army, Sir Patrick Sanders, just declared that Britain must prepare for a war with Russia. As we read in WIO News:

UK’s new top Army general General Sir Patrick Sanders has asked every soldier to prepare to fight against the Russian army in a potential World War III.

General Sanders, who took over from General Sir Mark Carleton Smith on Monday, told the British soldiers that they must prepare “to fight in Europe once again” as the conflict in Ukraine continues.

“There is now a burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle,” Sir Patrick said.

According to The Sun, the warning came in his first speech since he became Chief of the General Staff this month, taking overall control of the British Army.

“We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once again.”

“I am the first Chief of the General Staff since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a continental power,” General Sanders added.

“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose — to protect the UK by being ready to fight and win wars on land.”


Columnist Mikhail Rostovsky finds it very strange that Sanders apparently believes that the war between Russia and NATO can be non-nuclear. The expert recalls that during the Cold War, an acute conflict never developed into a hot stage due to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.

For some reason, Sanders believes that NATO will be able to fight Russia without the participation of nuclear forces. Rostovsky is surprised that in Poland there are also many who want to make war with Russia."

Alsynov’s conviction for inciting ethnic hatred sparked rare large-scale protests in Russia, where the risk of arrest typically stifles such demonstrations. Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. 

The activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. 

Alsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. 

Alsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020.

 The ball is in the United States’ court as to whether payments due on Wednesday on two Russian dollar-denominated Eurobonds will go through, and Washington should clarify whether the settlements are possible, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.

The economic cost of Russia’s actions in Ukraine has been fully exposed as President Vladimir Putin’s sanctions-ravaged government teeters on the brink of its first international debt default since the Bolshevik revolution.

Speaking in an interview with RT Arabic, Siluanov said Russia had sent an order on Monday to a correspondent bank for the payment of $117 million in coupons, and that it was now up to authorities in the United States on whether to accept it.

“The capability or incapability of meeting our obligations in foreign currency equivalent does not depend on us, we have the money, we have made the payment, now the ball is in the court, primarily, of the American authorities,” Siluanov said.

Sanctions have cut Russia off from key parts of global financial markets and have frozen nearly half of the country’s $640 billion gold and foreign exchange reserves. Siluanov said the block on its dollar account meant there were risks the payment would not reach the final, intended recipients.

“The payment has reached the correspondent American bank,” Siluanov said. “At the moment the payment is being processed and we do not yet have reports on whether it has gone through or not. It has not been cleared yet.

“But we know that the bank is in talks with OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) and has requested specific information from us about the purpose of the payment.”

Russia has said it will make the payments in roubles if dollar payments fail to go through but ratings agency Fitch has said that would constitute a sovereign default. if not corrected within a 30-day grace period."

 A young man shot a Russian military officer on Monday at an enlistment center, citing grievances of the Kremlin's partial mobilization for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.

Authorities said the officer was in intensive care as they announced Zinin's arrest — pledging the harshest possible punishment. According to local news, Zinin had been called up to fight by Moscow and was prepared for deployment on Tuesday.

The news comes as countless protests have sprung up across Russia in stark defiance of Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to partially mobilize those with ""certain military specialty and relevant experience"" last week.

In part, the backlash is due to several reports indicating the mobilization is far more expansive than officially decreed.

Evidence surfaced on Friday showing Russian authorities visiting Buryat State University, with one individual stating they were taking ""students straight from classes,"" Newsweek noted.

""The cops are on my campus, 10-15 people,"" a student wrote in a chat room, with a clip emerging one day later of military vehicles outside the building.

The news also breaks hours after a school shooting in the central Russian city of Izhevsk led to the deaths of 17 people, including 11 children, according to The Washington Post.

The suspected gunman is 34-year-old resident Artem Kazantsev, who reportedly brandished a Nazi armband during the attack and has a history of visiting his local psychological clinic.

Russian authorities have claimed the mass shooting incident, which injured at least 23 other people, is unconnected to Putin's order."

The West has destroyed free global competition and the immunity of property, Russia’s foreign minister says

The US is using the dollar to unleash trade wars worldwide, while international economic cooperation is also being weaponized, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.

The US and its allies in the EU are using a wide range of “geopolitical engineering” tools, which include, among other things “unleashing trade and economic wars,” Lavrov stated, speaking at the Primakov Readings International Forum.

“The activities of the World Trade Organization, primarily for settling disputes, have been blocked by Western countries. Such fundamental legal foundations of world economic relations as free competition and the immunity of property have been destroyed,” the Russian diplomat noted.

Lavrov went on to assert that the American currency has long been used as a weapon, adding that “destructive actions” by Western nations have resulted in producing the opposite effect to the intended one. The diplomat argued that US-led sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and crippling its economy in reality have stimulated the “strengthening of multipolarity in international affairs.”

According to Lavrov, there is a growing awareness in the world that “no one is immune” in the face of the “aggressive actions of Washington and Brussels.”

He noted that not only Russia but many other countries are now “consistently” reducing their dependence on Western currencies by switching to alternatives for foreign-trade settlements.

The global trend towards using national currencies in trade instead of the US dollar began to gain momentum last year after Ukraine-related sanctions saw Russia cut off from the Western financial system and also saw its foreign reserves frozen.

As multipolarity takes shape, more nations are working on creating new transport corridors and supply chains. Meanwhile, an “unfair” and “unbalanced” model of globalization has become outdated, Lavrov said."

 FT: Kiev will call for peace even if Trump loses the election

LONDON, August 14th. /tass/. The West will put pressure on Kiev, calling for an end to the conflict, even if US presidential candidate Donald Trump loses the election. This was reported by the Financial Times (FT) newspaper.

According to her, Kiev knows that it will be under increasing pressure to achieve negotiations on ending the conflict. And this will happen regardless of whether Trump wins the election, the publication emphasizes.

The former US president has repeatedly stated that he is able to achieve peace in Ukraine overnight, but did not specify exactly how. But several of his former officials and advisers have suggested that this could include an unofficial cession of territory in exchange for meaningful Western security guarantees for Kiev, writes FT.

Ukraine and several of its European allies are concerned about this course of events, but with the current level of Western military support and internal mobilization of Ukraine's resources, Kiev has no viable path to victory, the publication emphasizes. Europe has no desire to step up its efforts. Although the Europeans ""recognize"" that more will have to be done to arm Ukraine, ""there is no substantive discussion of options,"" the FT quoted a senior European official as saying.

On June 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting with the leadership of the Foreign Ministry, named the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine. Among them are the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) from Donbass and Novorossiya, Kiev's refusal to join NATO. In addition, Russia considers it necessary to lift all Western sanctions against it and establish Ukraine's non-aligned and nuclear-free status. Kiev rejected the Russian peace plan. After the massive attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Kursk region, which began on August 6, the Russian leader said that negotiations with the government attacking civilians were pointless."

In short, it looks like they took treasonous bribes, and this may be just scratching the surface. How many other people in the Washington, D.C. swamp got a cut of Biden booty? We don’t know, but the evidence presented this week shows the Bidens, including the President (aka “The Big Guy”), took money from foreign sources, including China. The Constitution clearly says a President can be impeached for taking a bribe.

While the Lying Legacy Media ignores evidence of real crime, they are reporting on the crimes being made up by the Biden Administration DOJ. The Deep State wants to jail President Trump so he cannot run in 2024 for another term in the White House. Will they use the J6 strategy that got convictions of 350 protesters at the capitol so far? It sure looks that way, and even President Trump is expecting charges soon, which is the ultimate election interference.

There is no doubt America is at war with Russia. We keep sending in arms and munitions, and there are no peace talks whatsoever. Now, a bridge linking Russia to Crimea has been blown up again, and the Russians responded by destroying a port in Ukraine that exports wheat. Higher food prices and shortages will be hitting the world soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is under attack, and a new global currency is going to be released by the so-called BRICS countries. Is a new currency war coming to go along with the real war already underway? The short answer is yes, and this spells big trouble to the buck."

merican fast-food giant McDonald said Monday it will exit Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, ending a more than three-decade run begun in the hopeful period near the end of the Cold War.

The restaurant chain, which launched in Moscow in January 1990 to great fanfare almost two years before the Soviet Union was dissolved, characterized the withdrawal as difficult but necessary.

""The humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald's to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald's values,"" the company said in a statement.

The chain is looking to sell ""its entire portfolio of McDonald's restaurants in Russia to a local buyer.""

The burger giant is one of numerous foreign firms that have pulled out of the country or suspended operations following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in late February.

Earlier on Monday, French automaker Renault announced it had handed over its Russian assets to the government, marking the first major nationalization since the onset of Western sanctions against Moscow's military campaign.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into pro-Western Ukraine on February 24, triggering unprecedented sanctions and sparking an exodus of foreign corporations including H&M, Starbucks and Ikea."

 The Russian military shot down a Ukrainian hot air balloon over the Kursk region of Russia. They wanted to use the aerostat to carry out a terrorist attack on targets inside Russia, the Defence Ministry said.

The department noted that on April 16 at about 8:15 a.m., air defence systems shot down a small hot air balloon over the territory of the Kursk region. No other details of the incident were provided.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine used similar aircraft during the special military operation. At the end of March, soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces shot down a ""terrorist balloon”, which was disguised as a probe.

The improvised hot air balloon bombers are equipped with a GPS tracker, flight control equipment, ballast, an explosive device and batteries. Coordinates for dropping the explosives are entered into the navigation controller of the balloon. Externally, the aerostat is disguised as a weather balloon to avoid damage.

The accuracy of such drones is not high for hitting targets on the contact line, so they are used to drop bombs on populated areas.

In February 2023, former Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said that Russia was using balloons with radar corner reflectors to deplete Kyiv's air defence system.

Specially equipped balloons can be used to combat drones, Sergei Bendin, acting head of the Moscow branch of the Aeronautics Commission of the Russian Geographical Society said.

Manned and unmanned airships may carry means of electronic warfare that could protect the military from drones. In addition, balloons and airships can be used for reconnaissance and communications relay.

It is worthy of note that the US Army also considers upgrading its fleet of hot air balloons that can be used for reconnaissance and communication purposes to possibly counter Russia and China.

 The Moscow stock exchange announced on Wednesday that it will stop trading in dollars and euros.

The announcement came on the same day that the United States introduced a new package of sanctions against Russia and came into effect from Thursday, June 13.

The Moscow Exchange on Thursday suspended trading in dollars and euros after it was sanctioned by the United States in a new raft of restrictions aimed at hindering Russia’s ability to wage war in Ukraine.

“Due to the introduction of restrictive measures by the United States against the Moscow Exchange Group… from June 13, 2024, trading on the Moscow Exchange markets will be conducted… with the exception of instruments with settlements in U.S. dollars and euros,” the exchange said in a statement.

“In the face of new challenges, the Moscow Exchange will continue to provide clients with access to all segments of the trading platform,” it added.

Later Thursday, the Russian Central Bank said it would suspend morning trading on the Moscow Exchange’s foreign exchange, precious metals and derivatives markets from Friday until further notice.

Russia’s National Clearing Center, which acts as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions at the Moscow Exchange, was also hit by U.S. sanctions.

The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday widened sanctions against Russia aimed at cutting the flow of money and goods to Moscow as it continues to wage war on neighboring Ukraine. The sanctions targeted more than 300 entities, including those in Russia and countries like China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

“Vladimir Putin has approved a series of measures to further attract capital through [the Moscow Exchange] from both Russian and non-Russian persons from ‘friendly countries’,” the U.S. Treasury Department said in its announcement of the new sanctions."

 Two men in Russia braved their lives and rescued a girl from a burning building. The footage of the rescue has gone viral and both the men are being praised for their bravery. The video was captured from a distance, that shows the girl being rescued by her neighbours.

According to REN TV, a fire broke out in an apartment on Dorozhnaya Street in Russia’s Moscow on 29 January. On an immediate call, the emergency services rushed to the spot and controlled the situation well, the local TV added.

The reason for the fire was a short circuit, local news media Izvestia reported.

Reports suggest that three people were injured in the fire and 12 others were rescued from the house. They were later examined by doctors for immediate medical care and treatment. The fire had almost completely engulfed the apartment on the ninth floor of the building.

In the video, thick black smoke can be seen rising out of the windows of the building. From one of those windows, a girl is trying to escape her apartment as two men from the apartment below come to help her.

The video becomes nail-biting when the two men stand on the ledge of their narrow window. They are also seen holding on to the frame of the window to support the girl. After struggling for several minutes, the girl tries to climb down to escape the fire. Meanwhile, the men are seen holding her legs and then her body carefully.

The 52-second video went viral on several Reddit subgroups where the footage of the miraculous rescue shocked viewers.


An eyewitness to the incident told 360 TV channel that the men, who saved the girl, were also injured in the process.

After the video went viral, the Ministry of Emergency Situations are looking out for the two men to thank them for their heroic act."

 Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen does not live in reality. She is not a trusted source of information but rather a Deep State puppet who pushes propaganda unsuccessfully. Yellen wants you to believe that America’s economy is stronger than ever with unlimited funds for all besides the actual citizens who pay taxes.


When asked if America could fund two major wars, Yellen told Sky News, “Absolutely!”.

“America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel’s military needs, and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The American economy is doing extremely well,” Yellen said.

The US national debt is now at $33.56 trillion with a defense budget of around $800 billion. We are funding layaway wars with no intention of ever paying back a penny to our debtors. They may strategize war, but they’re not strategizing war from an economic standpoint.

China was the largest purchaser of US debt but they have been abandoning US debt and the dollar entirely.

Yellen called the US debt downgrade “arbitrary” when Fitch Ratings downgraded US long-term debt late from AAA to AA+. The agency cited the debt ceiling negotiations and frequent government shutdowns as one of the reasons for the downgrade, and this was prior to the US losing its Speaker of the House for the first time in history.

Another reason is simply that China is disinvesting in the dollar.

The $2 billion sent to Israel is merely the beginning since the full-scale war has not yet begun. The two wars will merge into one when other nations become involved.

Israel could easily defeat Palestine on its own without foreign aid. But once the major players like China and Russia intervene it will take the full force and funding of NATO.

War has become the #1 economic priority for America’s politicians. “We” do not want to fund any wars but have no say in the matter since the elections are rigged, the data is inaccurate, and the truth is concealed by lie after lie."

 Russia is planning to hold war games near Ireland’s coast in international waters, which are “not welcome,” Ireland’s foreign minister said on Jan. 24 amid heightened tensions near the Russia–Ukraine border.

“This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told reporters.

Coveney said the exercises are slated to take place about 150 miles off Ireland’s southwest coast within its airspace and exclusive economic zone.

“The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks,” Coveney said.

He added that Ireland doesn’t have the “power to prevent this happening but, certainly, I’ve made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it’s not welcome.”

The remarks come as Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, demanding that Ukraine not join NATO. Russia also has denied it is planning an invasion, and it says the Western accusations are merely a cover for NATO’s own planned provocations.

Russia invaded Ukraine to annex the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Meanwhile, Moscow also backed pro-Russian separatists fighting in the eastern portion of the country known as the Donbas.

NATO will “take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies,” said Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance’s secretary-general. “We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense.”

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed the United States and NATO for sword-rattling and fear-mongering.

“All this is happening not because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is happening because of what NATO, the U.S. are doing,” Peskov told reporters, citing what he described as false reports that Russia is allegedly evacuating diplomats from Ukraine. Moscow has denied those claims."

 The United States was the top exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) during the first half of 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a July 25 report.

In the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first half of 2022, international LNG and natural gas prices hit record highs, the EIA said.

At the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands, energy has been trading at record high prices since October 2021. The TTF averaged $30.94 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the first half of 2022.

In the United States, nominal LNG export capacity has risen by 1.9 Bcf/d and peak capacity has risen by 2.1 Bcf/d since November 2021. The U.S. LNG liquefaction capacity averaged 11.4 Bcf/d as of July 2022, with the short-term peak capacity at 13.9 Bcf/d.

Energy companies increased production capacity at LNG facilities in Corpus Christi and Sabine Pass in Texas and the Calcasieu Pass LNG facility in Louisiana.

An unplanned outage at the Freeport LNG export facility in Quintana, Texas, caused U.S. exports to fall by 11 percent in June compared to the average exports in the first five months of the year.

Liquefied Natural Gas in the EUMost of America’s LNG exports during the period of January through May 2022 went to the United Kingdom and the European Union, which accounted for a combined 81 percent of total U.S. exports. The United States accounted for 47 percent of Europe’s total LNG imports in the first half of 2022. LNG imports in the UK and EU rose by 63 percent in the period from January through June 2022.

The EU’s demand for LNG is booming due to historically low natural gas storage inventories and the region’s push to limit imports from Russia.

Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the EU has implemented several sanctions against the Russian government. In response, the Kremlin has curtailed gas shipments via the pipeline into Europe.

“Gas supply from other sources has increased by 75 percent compared to last year,” she said."

 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 26 granted full Russian citizenship to Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked information about the U.S. agency’s widespread domestic surveillance operations during the Obama administration.

Snowden, 39, fled to Russia in 2013 from the United States after he posted secret files that revealed the NSA’s operations. U.S. authorities have for years sought to bring Snowden back and arrest him on espionage charges.

The former NSA contractor was granted permanent Russian residency in 2020. At the time, Snowden said he planned to apply for Russian citizenship and wouldn’t renounce his U.S. citizenship. In 2020, a U.S. appeals court found that the program Snowden had exposed was unlawful and said that U.S. officials who had publicly defended it weren’t telling the truth.

“Will Snowden be drafted?” Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the state media outlet RT, wrote in a darkly humorous tone on her Telegram channel. She was referring to last week’s speech from Putin in which the Russian leader said he would partially mobilize his country’s forces amid the Ukraine conflict.

‘I Didn’t Cooperate’Putin, a former KGB official, publicly stated in 2017 that Snowden was wrong to leak intelligence secrets but didn’t believe him to be a traitor to the United States. Since moving to Russia, Snowden rarely makes remarks on Russian domestic affairs and reportedly keeps a low profile.

Snowden in 2019 told news outlets that he was willing to return to the United States if he could be guaranteed a fair trial.

“People look at me now and they think I’m this crazy guy, I’m this extremist or whatever. Some people have a misconception that [I] set out to burn down the NSA,” Snowden also told NPR. “But that’s not what this was about. In many ways, 2013 wasn’t about surveillance at all. What it was about was a violation of the Constitution.”

Since then, he’s amassed more than 5.3 million followers on Twitter. There was no immediate reaction from Snowden on social media or elsewhere after he was granted Russian citizenship."

 he Ukraine and Russia crisis is expected to have a positive impact on Indonesia's trade, with most of the country’s exports benefiting from surging commodity prices.

Indonesia’s top exports include crude palm oil (CPO), coal and metals like aluminum, copper and nickel, all of which have seen price surges in the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The two Eastern European countries are also big exporters of coal and these metals.

At the same time, Indonesia is a big importer of crude oil and certain food commodities, such as wheat and soybeans. The two Eastern European countries are also big on some of these commodities.

“This is the consequence of becoming a net exporter of commodities. Despite the hike in oil prices, we are still gaining amid the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe,” said David Sumual, chief economist at Bank Central Asia (BCA), Indonesia's largest private lender, on March 11.

Global commodity prices have been rising this year as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the price spike has been exacerbated by the war raging in Eastern Europe. Prices of nickel, coal and aluminum, as well as agricultural commodities like wheat, have surged to multiyear highs, with some hitting all-time peaks.

Coal prices passed US$439 per ton on March 8, a fivefold increase from last year, according to Business Insider data. The same data also shows that CPO reached 8,163 ringgit ($1,939) per ton on March 1, almost doubling from the same period last year. The two commodities alone account for around a quarter of Indonesia's annual exports.

The current system has “run out of steam,” the president told supporters in a campaign speech Joe Biden speaks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington DC, October 19, 2023 © AP / Jonathan Ernst

The current US-led world order has “sort of run out of steam,” but Washington will shape the system that replaces it, US President Joe Biden told supporters on Saturday. Leaders in Moscow and Beijing, however, have argued otherwise.

Speaking at a campaign reception in Washington, Biden bragged about how he convinced Japan and South Korea to send financial aid to Ukraine, and how he signed a rail and ports deal with the EU, India, and Saudi Arabia at the G20 summit in New Delhi last month.

“So, I think we have an opportunity to do things, if we’re bold enough and have enough confidence in ourselves, to unite the world in ways that it never has been,” Biden declared.

“We were in a post-war period for 50 years where it worked pretty damn well, but that’s sort of run out of steam. Sort of run out of steam. We need a new, new world order in a sense,” he continued.

The world order that emerged following the Second World War was a bipolar one, with the US and USSR vying for influence and geopolitical supremacy. The collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in a unipolar world order, with the US the sole superpower. As the USSR disintegrated, then-US President George HW Bush proclaimed victory in the Cold War and the dawning of a “new world order” in his 1991 State of the Union address.

Three decades later, and with Washington scrambling for funds to fight two foreign wars, American dominance is less assured. China’s economy was the world’s eleventh largest in 1991, but is now second to only the US’. With Beijing expanding its nuclear arsenal and modernizing its military, President Xi Jinping has referred to the US-led West as “declining” on multiple occasions, and hailed the emergence of a “multipolar world,” in which international relations are governed by laws and treaties, rather than US-enforced “rules.”"

Rape is synonymous with war and always has been.

Consider the reality: Hordes of men run rampant across the landscape, destroying everything in their path. Russian President Vladimir Putin knew this would be one of the results, especially as men put in these positions consider women as meaningless objects, to be used, abused and discarded as nothing more than trash.

When the dust finally settles, and these violent sexual criminals are facing justice in the world court, I truly hope the sentence fits the crime.

Reading some of the stories of women who’ve managed to survive the assaults to mind and body makes me realize there is no civility and never will be until these crimes are erased from the books — and we all know that’ll never happen, because this is another example of full-circle history.

 Ukraine abandoned a draft peace treaty with Russia in 2022 due to British pressure, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has claimed.

The deal, which could have ended the Ukraine conflict weeks after it first began, was approved by negotiators in Istanbul, but Ukraine later pulled out of the talks.

RT reports: The German newspaper Welt reported on Friday that Moscow had issued additional demands after a deal had already been outlined, such as making Russian the second official language in Ukraine, implying that this had ended any hopes of an agreement.

Peskov denied those claims on Saturday, citing remarks made by Ukrainian MP David Arakhamia, who led Kiev’s delegation at the talks.

In an interview to domestic media last November, Arakhamia said then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had intervened in the peace process and had urged the Ukrainians to “just fight” Russia.

Kiev effectively discarded the deal under “direct pressure by London,” Peskov stressed. “The rest is speculation. I suggest we learn from the source.”

Asked whether the draft treaty could serve as a basis for further peace talks, Peskov said Kiev’s public position was to reject talks with Russia. The idea of reviving the failed agreement was floated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko when he met Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin earlier this month.

Johnson has denied derailing the peace talks, but has also bragged on multiple occasions about his policy of nudging Kiev into continuing hostilities with Russia, which the British politician claims to be a fight for global democracy.

“There could be no more effective way of investing in Western security than investing in Ukraine, because those guys without a single pair of American boots on the ground are fighting for the West,” Johnson told students at Georgetown University during a visit to the US this month. The Ukrainians “are effectively fighting our own fight, fighting for our own interests,” he added.

Russian officials have described the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Moscow, which the US and its allies allegedly intend to wage “to the last Ukrainian.” Their goal, according to Moscow, is to contain Russia and stall its development, rather than protect the interests of the Ukrainian people."

Sound familiar?

Without the direct knowledge, say-so, or approval of the ailing US President, a group of senior Washington officials plan in top secrecy to persuade Germany to recover all the eastern European territories which the German Army took in World War II – including Austria, the Czech Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor, and the western region of Ukraine known as Galicia. In return, the Germans should agree to resuming their war against Russia on US terms.

This was known in Washington as the M PROJECT. It was devised by a group of American co-religionists, with a common ethnic origin and a shared belief in the evil of everything Russia stood for, including their religion.

The M PROJECT was the brainchild of the head of US intelligence, the White House military advisor, and other generals and admirals. They were all Irish-American Roman Catholics.

Through a special emissary code-named DAISY, they attempted to recruit their German co-religionists in the plan. To earn their reward, the Germans’ job was to arrange a coup d’état in Berlin; kill Adolph Hitler; and hurry up, before the Russian Army made good its advance through Ukraine, Poland, and on to Berlin.

This was the M PROJECT of 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt knew nothing of it. It failed, but the secret was kept for more than thirty years. By then, the US didn’t need to persuade the Germans by killing their chancellor.

 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised President Joe Biden's surprise Monday visit to Ukraine — four days from the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of the neighboring country — by saying it sends ""the right signal"" to the world.

""I am very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine, and meet with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,"" Graham said in a statement. ""This was the right signal to send at the right time. A presidential visit to Ukraine, along with the statements made by Vice President [Kamala] Harris at the Munich Security Conference that Russia is committing crimes against humanity in Ukraine, are a powerful combination.""

Last week, Harris said the U.S. has already determined that Russia committed ""crimes against humanity"" during its war with Ukraine, which launched Feb. 24, 2022.

While meeting with Zelenskyy, Biden made a new pledge of $460 million in aid for Ukraine, according to The Washington Post.

Graham would also like U.S. officials to go further with their latest investment by sending advanced fighter jets to Ukraine and designating Russia for the ""State Sponsors of Terror"" list, which currently includes Iran, Cuba, Syria, and North Korea.

""For the visits and statements to matter to their fullest extent, decisive action must immediately follow,"" Graham said.

""We must designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. That would also help ensure any lethal assistance to Russia, provided by China, is devastating to the Chinese economy ... we should start immediately training Ukrainian pilots and maintainers, and provide them the advanced fighter jets to not only win this war, but deter future aggression.""

Biden's visit to Ukraine drew criticism from prominent Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Chief among Republican complaints: Biden visited Ukraine, which isn't a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but has yet to visit the embattled Ohio village of East Palestine, which is dealing with the fallout of a recent 50-car train derailment, toxic chemical spill, and subsequent chemical explosion."

 The United States plans to pick up the slack in producing elementary school textbooks in Ukraine as the country’s printing industry continues to suffer in the war with Russia.

“Russia is waging a war not just against the Ukrainian military, but also against the Ukrainian people,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a June 24 statement.

Mr. Sullivan said some of these Russian attacks have manifested in the form of strikes targeting printing presses throughout Ukraine, including the Faktor-Druk printing house in Kharkiv, which he described as one of the largest printing houses in all of Europe. The Kharkiv region in northeastern Ukraine has been a focal point for renewed fighting in recent weeks.

“Kharkiv’s printing houses produce a significant percentage of all books in Ukraine, including textbooks for Ukrainian children. By striking these printing houses, Russia is attacking Ukraine’s education system. We will not let Russia succeed,” Mr. Sullivan said.

The White House official said the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will assist Ukraine in printing more than 3 million textbooks for elementary school students in the country ahead of the next school year. Mr. Sullivan said this textbook production effort will take place inside Ukraine and that the finished books will be distributed to more than 12,000 schools around the country.

“Our message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia’s barbaric war of aggression,” Mr. Sullivan said.

He didn’t specify how much the textbook production run would cost, from where USAID would draw the funds, or where the new production efforts would take place to avoid additional disruptions from Russian attacks. The Epoch Times reached out to both the White House and USAID for further comment but didn’t receive a response from either by press time.

The U.S. government has designated some $173 billion for direct and indirect aid to Ukraine since Russian forces launched their large-scale military campaign there in February 2022, most recently allocating about $60 billion for Ukraine in a foreign aid supplemental that Congress passed in April. While much of the U.S. support for Ukraine has been in the form of shipments of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment to assist in the fighting, Ukraine also has received humanitarian aid and direct financial support."

Amir Weitmann, the head of the libertarian caucus in Israel’s Likud Party, appeared on Russia’s RT last week and expressed his outrage at Russia’s stance on the war since fighting broke out.

“Russia is supporting the enemies of Israel. Russia is supporting Nazi people who want to commit genocide on us and Russia will pay the price,” Weitmann said, according to Newsweek. “We’re gonna win this war. Afterwards, we’re not forgetting what you’re doing, we’re not forgetting, we will come, we will make sure Ukraine wins. We will make sure that you pay the price for what you have done, you as Russia.”

The host of the program said Moscow has been calling for a ceasefire and has been looking for a solution to the conflict in Israel.

“I understand you’re on the Russian payroll, and I understand this is Russian propaganda. But you have to be very careful, because, let me tell you, we’re going to finish this war. We’re going to win because we’re stronger,” he said, according to The New Voice of Ukraine.

The New York Times reported that Putin once had a relatively close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but since the outbreak of the Ukraine War, there seems to be a chill. The paper noted that as of Friday, the Russian leader has not reached out to his Israeli counterpart.

Instead, Putin—while condemning the Hamas attack—said the incident was a “clear example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East.” While making clear that he believes Israel has an obligation to defend itself, Washington’s knee-jerk reaction is to never take into account the “fundamental interests of the Palestinian people.”

Erdogan seemed to agree, saying: “If the West has the slightest respect for human rights, it must discuss the types of aid that should be sent to Gaza. There is no way to bring peace to the Middle East except through establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.”"

 OLEKSANDR USYK has denied Ukraine’s heartbreaking invasion can be used as positive motivation against Anthony Joshua.

The 35-year-old barely got to celebrate his September win over the Brit icon, at Tottenham’s stadium for the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight world titles, before his home was invaded by Russia.

The devout husband and father cut short a February trip to England - where he visited Stamford Bridge to watch Chelsea - to race back to Kyiv and take up arms.

The London 2012 Olympic gold medal winner and former undisputed cruiserweight king was pictured with a machine gun over his shoulder as he held the line against Vladimir Putin’s invaders.

And - as recently as March - Usyk and his team were still unsure if they could take part in the August 20 Saudi Arabia rematch, with the country still in such turmoil.

The defending champ received special dispensation and encouragement to escape the war and represent his proud nation on the grandest stage and help shine a light on their continued plight.

But - after Tuesday’s Jeddah press conference, where Usyk stared Joshua down in their tense face-off - he refused to use the humanitarian crisis to his advantage.

Usyk said: ""My friends, people close to me, have died in the war.

“When so many people are suffering I don't have any idea how it can influence anything positively.

""I was there for one month, I saw with my own eyes what happened there, rockets flying and fighter jets flying. It's horrible.""

Usyk was much more guarded on the stage where he and Joshua bumped fists for the first time in almost a year.

Hiding his ice-cold glare from everyone bar AJ under his bucket hat, the southpaw sensation did almost nothing to help sell the fight and everything to frighten his old foe.

He said: “I never make loud or bright speeches, I just work hard in my gym and training camp.

""That’s what I am going to do until the fight.

“And then I will enter the ring and make you happy with my boxing.”

 The Biden administration continues to lead the world in contributions to Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in tax payers’ money promised or sent as aid, as American citizens suffering from disasters at home are told there is no money for them.

The Biden administration rejected a request for federal disaster assistance from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine following the train derailment disaster in East Palestine that led to an unprecedented release of highly toxic chemicals, just days after the CDC edited the toxicology profile for vinyl chloride, massively increasing the lethal exposure level and removing information about how the chemical affects children

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Ohio’s state government that it was not eligible for disaster assistance to help the community recover from the toxic spill, Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for DeWine, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Tierney explained that FEMA believed the incident didn’t qualify as a traditional disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, for which it usually provides assistance.

According to Zelensky’s Ukrainian government, the US leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between January 24, 2022 through November 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

It is clear where Biden’s loyalties lie and the people of Ohio do not figure in that equation.

Fox reports: In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).

Some members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.

“How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?” asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. “Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which red line we set will we not later cross?”

The proposal also urges Ukraine and Russia to seek a peace deal, requiring them to renew their negotiations."

Dear President Trump!

My name is Faina Savenkova. I am a teenager living in Donbass. I am 15 years old, and I am a young writer and journalist. However, the Ukrainian government sees me just as one of many civilian targets in this war. In my short life, I have had to endure the horrors of war due to the weapons that Western countries supply to Ukraine. I know that there was recently an attempt on your life. I am very glad that the perpetrator did not succeed because human life is the greatest gift given to us by God. But the deadly threat that you face is the threat that the children of Donbass face every day at the hands of Ukraine’s extremist government.

July 27th is the Day of Remembrance for the Children Victims of the War in Donbass. On July 27, 2014, the Ukrainian military launched a massive artillery strike on Horlivka, resulting in the deaths of 22 civilians, including children. Yes, the war in Ukraine began in 2014. Since then, the aggression of the Ukrainian authorities and army towards the civilians of Donbass has only intensified, which is why we want to live in the safety Russian Federation. The list of deceased children is only growing, as they continue to die due to the ambitions of adults. This must be stopped as soon as possible.

In one of your speeches to American voters, you said that you want to make America great again. Mr. Trump, the greatness of a country depends not only on the amount of weaponry it supplies to other countries, such as Ukraine, but also on whether this country can stop supplying those weapons that kill innocents. President Biden started the war in Ukraine, and now every day, hundreds of Ukrainians die on the battlefield. You may not consider yourself a friend of Russia, but I am sure that you can help bring this conflict to a speedy end. I also hope that Russia and the United States can establish a dialogue for the sake of mankind's future and the entire planet."

 Russia’s state-owned arms company, Rosoboronexport, has declared its intention to participate in the bidding process for the supply of light tanks and the Future Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) to India.

Alexander Mikheyev, the CEO of the Russian company announced the decision with the state-run media outlet TASS during the International Aerospace Exhibition at Dubai Airshow 2023.

Mikheyev outlined plans for collaboration with Indian partners, to introduce a light tank and an advanced infantry fighting vehicle as part of the Indian Ministry of Defense’s FICV project tender. Emphasizing alignment with the principles of the ‘Make in India’ program, he highlighted the intention to contribute to local manufacturing.

In his statements, Mikheyev underlined Russia’s comprehension of the Indian government’s aspirations, acknowledging India’s commitment to achieving technological sovereignty and promoting independent industrial development. The proposed plans reflect a collaborative approach that adheres to the principles of the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Earlier, Russia signed a contract to supply Igla-S hand-held anti-aircraft missiles to India and allow production of the Igla there under licence, the Russian state news agency TASS quoted a top arms export official as saying on Tuesday.

The Igla-S is a man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) that can be fired by an individual or crew to bring down an enemy aircraft.

India is the world’s largest arms importer and Russia remains its largest supplier despite the damage to the reputation of its army and weaponry from the war in Ukraine, where Russia has suffered numerous setbacks at the hands of a smaller but highly motivated and Western-equipped military.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia accounted for 45% of India’s arms imports between 2018 and 2022, with France providing 29% and the United States 11%.

Another Russian state news agency, RIA, quoted Mikheyev earlier as saying that “Rosoboronexport is working with Indian private and public enterprises to organise joint production of aviation weapons and integrate them into the existing aviation fleet in India”.

No details were provided about which Indian companies would be involved or when potential production would start.

Mikheyev said Rosoboronexport and Indian partners had provided the Indian Ministry of Defence with Su-30MKI fighter jets, tanks, armoured vehicles and shells. At the beginning of the year, India and Russia also started joint production of AK-203 Kalashnikov assault rifles."

The West is increasingly losing patience with supporting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in the war with Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is “fed up” with the money pit that has become this war.

Plus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that “everyone is fed up” with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.

According to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there’s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.

Sosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an “arrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,” from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of “bad” consequences should she “catch” the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. “We are going to war for Zelensky’s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!” Sosoaca stated.

Stop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War

According to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader’s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.

The opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. –RT

Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make “twice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].” Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate."
EN_UA_300044.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Fed Drives a Stake Into Own Rate-Setting 'Newthink' 

 Rest in peace, flexible average inflation targeting. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points on Wednesday, spurred into the biggest single move since 1994 by surging prices.

That may not kill inflation – but it does effectively kill Chair Jay Powell’s 2-year-old push to emphasize inclusive employment.

In the end, rising prices forced Powell’s hand. In May, the Fed chief had said he favored steady 0.5 percentage-point rate increases to contain inflation. But then Labor Department data showed consumer prices rising 8.6% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 1981. And Americans’ median expectations for inflation in May 2023 increased, according to a New York Fed survey released on Monday.

That has made the Fed’s newish framework, flexible average inflation targeting, acronym FAIT, untenable. Back in 2020, Powell said that after years of inflation below the central bank’s 2% target, it would shift to a new, flexible approach.

Rates would be allowed to stay near zero, even if inflation went above 2% for a while, to make sure the economy was creating enough jobs for groups like Black workers, who are often the last to benefit from economic expansions and who weren’t considered separately in the old ways of rate-setting.

Aggressively raising rates now risks leaving those workers in the lurch. The unemployment rate for Black Americans in May was 6.2% compared to the overall 3.6% level and 3.2% for white employees.

And now the Fed projects the jobless pace will tick up the next few years. Elsewhere, expectations for debt delinquencies went up from April to May for those with an education level of a high school degree or less, according to the New York Fed survey. It will be for politicians, not central bankers, to decide how best to help those left behind.

There may still be room for Powell to innovate – for example, revisiting the 2% inflation target. The Fed failed to hit that on the way up for years, but the pandemic, trade wars and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have permanently altered supply chains and spending patterns.

The central bank’s June median projection for inflation this year is higher than in March at 5.2%.

Even so, all newthink is best left until prices have found their level."

 Top European human rights court cites Russia violations in Crimea

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Europe’s top human rights court has ruled that Russia was responsible for a string of human rights violations in Crimea since overrunning and later illegally annexing the Black Sea peninsula in 2014.

The European Court of Human Rights said in a lengthy written judgment this week that Moscow was responsible for rights violations including reining in freedom of expression, religion and assembly.

Russia also breached international humanitarian law by imposing its laws on the occupied peninsula, the Strasbourg, France-based court ruled.

The court said there was “a pattern of retaliatory prosecution and misuse of criminal law and a general crackdown on political opposition to Russian policies in Crimea, which had been developed and publicly promoted by prominent representatives of the Russian authorities.”

Ukrainian President Zelensky is all over Europe, including at the G-7. His message? Ukraine’s war with Russia and Putin is Europe’s fight, too.

The court is the legal arm of the Council of Europe, the continent’s foremost human rights body, which expelled Russia from its ranks more than two years ago after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The expulsion means that the court has no enforcement powers over Russia.

However, the ruling could bolster cases filed by individuals seeking reparations.

Moscow maintains that it rightfully took over Crimea after an overwhelming majority of local residents voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum. It has continuously rejected accusations of human rights violations in the region.

Ukraine and most Western governments, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany, condemned the annexation of Crimea as illegal, calling the referendum a sham.

In the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia, a Russia-style bill targeting civil society and independent media nears final enactment amid protests. Critics see a Kremlin hand.

In its written ruling, the court found Russia responsible for breaches including enforced disappearances and the abuse of Ukrainian soldiers, ethnic Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and journalists.

It also held Moscow responsible for discrimination including the harassment and intimidation of religious leaders, cracking down on non-Russian media, banning public gatherings and expressions of support for Ukraine, and suppressing the Ukrainian language in schools.

The decision Tuesday by the human rights court comes six months after the top United Nations court ruled that Moscow breached an international treaty on eradicating racial discrimination by limiting school education in Ukrainian and by maintaining a ban on a Tatar assembly called the Mejlis."

 HUGE explosions have rocked two key electricity supply stations in Russia in a suspected Ukrainian drone strike.

The attack sparked a raging inferno and is understood to have left thousands without power in the Belgorod region.

Belgorod governor said stations were hit in the city and another area in the wider region which borders Ukraine.

He said: ""In Belgorod and the Belgorod region, two fires were recorded at civilian facilities.

""There were no casualties. All emergency services are on site and the fire is under control.""

Reports said parts of Belgorod city - which has a population of 340,000 - suffered blackouts after a targeted strike on a crucial substation in the suburb of Igumenka.

Another in the village of Dragunskoe was hit, according to Baza media outlet which has close links to law enforcement.

The village is some six miles northwest of the city centre.

Belgorod is some 22 miles from the Ukrainian frontier.

Telegram channels said there had been explosions before fires erupted.

There were separate unconfirmed Ukrainian claims that a Murom-P mobile surveillance complex in Belgorod region has been destroyed.

Belgorod region has faced regular drone strikes from Ukrainian territory but not on the scale that Russia has hit Kyiv’s regions.

But Ukraine has also admitted to using sabotage tactics to cause fires in Russia.

Ukrainian intelligence chief Major-General Kyrylo Budanov has said that Russia was seeing many unusual explosions and fires.

“Much of this is no accident,” he said, admitting that Ukraine was paying Russian saboteurs.

“Something is constantly on fire [in Russia].

“Signalling equipment on railways, it lights up several times a day, on various highways constantly for two to three hours, sometimes for five to six hours, traffic gets suspended.”

The suspected strikes come as Ukraine is claimed to be preparing a counteroffensive to grab back territory from invading Russian forces.

Leaked classified US intelligence documents also appear to reveal Ukraine's plans.

One of the documents summarised the training schedules of 12 Ukraine combat brigades, and said nine of them were being trained by US and NATO forces, and needed 250 tanks and more than 350 mechanized vehicles.

The documents - at least one of which carried a ""top secret"" label - were circulated on pro-Russian government channels.

Information in the documents also details expenditure rates for munitions under Ukraine military control, including for the HIMARS rocket systems, the US-made artillery rocket systems that have proven highly effective against Russian forces."

Ukrainian forces have dropped a bomb near diesel tanks located at Russia’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, management at the facility reported on Thursday. The blast occurred near tanks containing diesel for backup generators at the Zaporizhzhia facility, according to management.

The plant has backup diesel generators, which kick on when the electricity supply from the power grid is cut off. Its equipment has to be powered continuously to ensure safe operation, even when nuclear reactors are not online. Blackouts have been a regular occurrence for the site since the beginning of the conflict, according to a report by RT.

In a video published on social media, plant director Yury Chernuk pointed to a crater in the ground, which he said had been created by an explosive device dropped from a Ukrainian drone.

Russia has said in the past that a Ukrainian attack is imminent.

Chernuk, noted that it was fortunate that “neither equipment nor personnel were damaged in the attack.”

”Destruction of those tanks or a fuel leak may not only cause a fire but also result in significant loss of diesel reserves. Consequently, the plant’s preparedness for emergencies would be reduced by orders of magnitude,” Chernuk explained. He also noted that Ukrainian forces had targeted the plant days after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, rotated observers stationed there. The organization told Russian media that it was aware of the incident, but offered no further comment.

In his view, this is just the latest directive that will result in hundreds of thousands of euros being siphoned off by Brussels from the pockets of Polish and European citizens. The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.

„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”

 Treason trial opens for L.A. woman held in Russia for donating $50 to Ukraine charity

MOSCOW — The trial of a Russian American dual citizen whom Russia accuses of treason opened Thursday as tensions rise between Washington and Moscow, including over the arrests of two American journalists.

The trial is being held behind closed doors in Yekaterinburg, in the same court that next week is to begin hearing the case of Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in March 2023 and charged with espionage.

The defendant was identified by Russian authorities as Los Angeles resident Ksenia Karelina, although U.S. media reports frequently use the surname Khavana, the name of her ex-husband.

A Russian American woman from Los Angeles is held in Russia on treason charges, apparently over a donation to a charity for Ukraine.

Karelina was born in Yekaterinburg and was arrested in February while visiting her family.

Russia’s main domestic security agency, the Federal Security Service, charges that Karelina raised money for a Ukrainian organization that was providing weapons, ammunition and other supplies to the Ukrainian military. Her boyfriend has said she made a single donation of about $50 to a Ukrainian organization, according to media reports.

Karelina faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Almost all Russian criminal cases that make it to court end in convictions. The trial was adjourned in the afternoon and the next session was set for Aug. 7, Russian news agencies said.

Gershkovich, the highest-profile American behind bars in Russia, is accused of gathering secret information from a tank factory in Nizhny Tagil, about 90 miles north of Yekaterinburg.

His employers deny the allegation, and the U.S. State Department has declared him to be wrongfully detained.

Ksenia Karelina, a U.S.-Russia dual citizen who was detained in Russia over an apparent donation to a Ukrainian aid group, appeared via video in court on Thursday. A judge denied her appeal.

Gershkovich’s trial, also closed, is to begin Wednesday.

A journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe with U.S. and Russian dual citizenship has been held since October on charges of gathering military information and failing to register as a foreign agent.

Since sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has sharply cracked down on dissent and has passed laws that criminalize criticism of the operation in Ukraine and remarks considered to discredit the Russian military. Concern has risen since then that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest."

‘Public opinion in the West is now built very clearly: everyone adheres to the idea that Russia is absolute evil, and the West is absolute good,’ says Italian artist Jorit Agoch.

With the beginning of the special operation in Ukraine, the Russian people in the West faced a substantial wave of Russophobia, which also swept the arts and sports.

Russian singers, artists and directors are finding their names crossed out from concert schedules and festival shortlists. The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra severed all relations with conductor Valery Gergiev, and the Carnegie Hall in New York cancelled performances by pianist Denis Matsuev.

Even those who are dead - Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich - became victims of Russophobia, and this list is growing every day.

How does Russian culture withstand this wave of aggression? Watch the film Killing Russian Culture."

 A top French politician has claimed that a large part of Western aid to Kiev is being embezzled by Ukrainian officials, despite President Zelensky’s assurances that it is being used in the fight against Russia.

Florian Philippot, leader of the Patriots (Les Patriotes) party and a long-time critic of Western assistance to Ukraine has alleged that Zelensky was lying when he claimed that all US aid to his country “goes to the battlefield.”

In a social media post on Friday he wrote: “In reality a large part is diverted and goes into corruption!”

RT reports: He noted Kiev’s admission last month that it had not received €16 billion ($17.1 billion) in aid collected by Poland and the European Commission. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal claimed he had “no idea” what happened to the funds.

Philippot also pointed to a recent corruption scandal involving Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolay Solsky, who is accused of illegally appropriating state land worth nearly €6.9 million ($7.4 million). “Yet another case of corruption in this country, which is one of the most corrupt on the planet!” the French politician remarked.

“Every euro sent to Ukraine prolongs the war and therefore causes unnecessary deaths, impoverishes us here, and has a strong chance of enriching the corrupt!” he added, calling for the conflict to be resolved as soon as possible.

Ukraine has been plagued by widespread graft for years, and a 2015 Guardian article described it as “the most corrupt nation in Europe.” More recently, it ranked 104 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.

The issue has taken center stage during the conflict with Russia, including in the Ukrainian military, which has been rocked by several graft scandals in recent months. This winter, Ukraine’s SBU, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, announced that it had uncovered a major embezzlement scheme in which Ukrainian officials and private contractors stole around $40 million earmarked for shell procurement.

Elsewhere, the Pentagon’s inspector general admitted that Washington had failed to properly track more than $1 billion in weapons sent to Ukraine, although this did not stop US officials from claiming that they believed the assistance to have reached its intended destination.

Russia, meanwhile, has for months been warning about the spillover of foreign weapons sent to Ukraine, cautioning that they are ending up in the hands of organized crime outside of the country."

 Russian cruise missiles, flying low and hugging the terrain to dodge Ukrainian air defenses, destroyed farm storage buildings in the Odesa region early Friday, Ukrainian officials said, as the Kremlin’s forces expanded their targets following three days of bombardment of the region’s Black Sea port infrastructure.

Two missiles struck the storage facility, starting a fire, and while workers fought to put it out another missile hit, destroying farm and firefighting equipment, the southern Odesa region’s Gov. Oleh Kiper said.

The attack injured two people and destroyed 100 metric tons of peas and 20 metric tons of barley, according to Kiper.

The attack was small-scale in comparison with barrages in recent days that put Odesa in Russia’s crosshairs after Moscow tore up a wartime deal that allowed Ukraine to send grain through the key Black Sea port.

Russia targeted Ukrainian critical grain export infrastructure after vowing to retaliate for an attack that damaged a crucial bridge between Russia and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.

Though Friday’s strike was more muted, the recent uptick in attacks has kept people in Odesa on edge.

“The enemy is continuing terror, and it’s undoubtedly related to the grain deal,” said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military’s Operational Command South.

Both Russia and Ukraine have announced that they will treat ships traveling to each other’s Black Sea ports as potential military targets.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the recent barrages in southern Ukraine are part of an overarching strategy.

“The Russian military’s intensifying strikes against Ukrainian port and grain infrastructure and threats of maritime escalation are likely a part of a Kremlin effort to leverage Russia’s exit from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and exact extensive concessions from the West,” it said in an assessment late Thursday.

The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the navy conducted drills that simulated action to seal off a section of the Black Sea.

In the maneuvers, a missile boat fired anti-ship cruise missiles at a mock target in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.

In other developments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced the resignation of the country’s Culture Minister, suggesting the ministry’s spending was misguided during wartime.

“Paving stones, city decorations, and fountains can wait till after the victory,” he said.

The move follows a series of recent scandals related to the expenditure of local authorities across the country, such as the repair of a cobblestone road in Kyiv’s city center or a renovation of a city fountain in a western Ukraine city."

 Appetite for Destruction: US Gambles on New Texas Factory to Churn Out Ammo for Ukraine

The Ukraine proxy conflict continues to feed the insatiable US cycle of arms spending and production, with yet another newly-unveiled manufacturing facility joining its ranks.

A Texas factory that reportedly cost US$500 million to build is geared towards boosting the gravy train of US warmongers.

NATO’s proxy conflict in Ukraine has an avid appetite for ammunition and has eaten its way into both US and EU stocks with lackluster results to show for it. The Pentagon is hoping the General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas, will help satiate this ammo craving.

American factories in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, together produce about 36,000 155mm shells per month. Managed by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD.N), the new Universal Artillery Projectile Lines facility jam-packed with cutting-edge machinery can churn out 30,000 units per month for the Kiev regime.

The plant was bankrolled through supplemental spending bills from FY 2022 and 2023, and boasts three production lines. Its novel equipment enables the manufacture of various shells and mortars on the same line. Empty shells made in Mesquite will be sent to a plant in Burlington, Iowa, for filling. The target goal is to churn out a monthly amount of 100,000 by the end of 2025.

 Donald Trump said on Saturday if he does not win November's presidential election it will mean the likely end of American democracy.

The Republican presidential candidate, speaking to supporters in Ohio, made the claim after repeating his baseless assertion that his 2020 election defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of election fraud.

During an outdoor speech that was whipped by strong winds and punctuated by some profane language, Trump predicted that if he does not win the Nov. 5 general election, American democracy will come to an end.

""If we don't win this election, I don't think you're going to have another election in this country,"" Trump said.

Trump, who is under criminal indictment in Georgia for trying to overturn the result of the 2020 election there, this week won enough delegates to mathematically clinch the Republican nomination.

A general election rematch with Biden is likely to be extremely close. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two candidates in a statistical tie with registered voters.

Trump opened his remarks in Dayton with a tribute to his supporters who are currently in jail for rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as they sought to block certification of Biden's 2020 election win.

Trump saluted and called them ""patriots"" and ""hostages"".

The former Republican president has been using increasingly dystopian rhetoric in his campaign speeches about the state of the country.

In the middle of a section in his speech about placing tariffs on imported cars, and foreign competition for the US auto industry, Trump declared: ""If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole country.""

Asked what he meant, his campaign pointed to a post on the social media platform X by a New York Times journalist, which said Trump's ""bloodbath"" comment came amid a discussion about the US auto industry and the economy.

Asked for a response to Trump's ""bloodbath"" comment, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer condemned Trump's ""extremism"", ""his thirst for revenge"", and his ""threats of political violence"".

Trump also appealed to Blacks and Hispanics, voters who will play a key role in deciding November's election.

Trump has been narrowing the gap with Biden in opinion polls with non-white voters, who formed a core part of Biden's winning coalition when he defeated Trump in 2020.

Trump cited a central campaign theme, that too many illegal immigrants have crossed the US-Mexico border since Biden took office, in his appeal to minority voters.

""No-one has been hurt by Joe Biden's migrant invasion more than our great African American and Hispanic communities,"" Trump said. He claimed without citing any evidence that illegal immigrants were taking their jobs."

 Kant's comments follow two back-to-back G20 ministerial meetings in India in the last three weeks overshadowed by the war, which entered its second year last month.

Russia's war in Ukraine has brought the world to a standstill when urgent action is needed to address growing global poverty, India's G20 summit negotiator Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday.

Kant's comments follow two back-to-back G20 ministerial meetings in India in the last three weeks overshadowed by the war, which entered its second year last month.

India, which holds the bloc's presidency this year, has sought to highlight the economic impact of the conflict as well as issues such as climate change and poorer countries' debt.

""Europe cannot bring growth, poverty, global debt, all developmental issues to a standstill across the world,"" Kant told reporters.

""Especially when the south is suffering, especially when 75 countries are suffering from global debt, especially when one-third of the world is in recession, especially when 200 million people have gone below poverty line. Can that one war bring the entire world to a standstill?""

""Nutrition has been impacted, health outcomes have been impacted, learning outcomes have been impacted, people have become stunted and wasted and we are just concerned with one Russia and Ukraine war,"" Kant said. ""The world needs to move on and Europe needs to find a solution to its challenges.""

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.

India has declined to blame Russia for the war and has sought a diplomatic solution while boosting its purchases of Russian oil.

Kant said it is ""premature"" to even talk about whether US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would attend a summit of leaders of the bloc in New Delhi on Sept. 9-10.

The Kremlin said on Monday that it was not ruling out Putin attending the summit.

Putin has not travelled beyond the former Soviet Union since sending his armed forces into Ukraine in February last year, and missed November's G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.

The G20 includes the rich G7 nations as well as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, among other countries."
EN_UA_300065.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"American Defense Contractors Keep Making Billions From Russia–Ukraine War 

 Major U.S. defense contractors such as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have benefited from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, raking in billions of dollars worth of contracts to supply weapons as the United States continues to spend money to assist Ukraine.

Lockheed Martin manufactures high-tech defense systems that have played a major role in protecting Ukrainian cities from bombardment by Russian aerial forces. Washington has already sent 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers to Ukraine. The Pentagon also plans to send 18 more HIMARS launchers at a cost of $1.1 billion.

In December 2022, the U.S. Army granted a $431 million contract to Lockheed Martin to produce HIMARS launchers to replenish its stocks as well as restock the supplies of its partners and allies who militarily support Ukraine. In October 2022, Lockheed was awarded a $14.4 million contract to raise the production capacity of the HIMARS launchers to 96 per year from 60.

In November 2022, Lockheed Martin won a $521 million contract to add to U.S. stocks of multiple-launch guided rocket systems, which also are supplied to Ukraine. The company has a positive outlook for its future business prospects.

Raytheon ContractsRaytheon won a $1.2 billion contract from the U.S. Army in November 2022 to deliver six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) batteries to Ukraine.

The contract was a follow-up to an August 2022 contract for a batch of NASAMS batteries. Two batteries have been delivered and deployed in the nation. In the United States, a NASAMS is in place to defend the national capital region from potential air threats.

Raytheon also produces the Stinger and Javelin missiles, both of which have been used in Ukraine. The company received a $624 million contract from the U.S. government for the Stinger missiles.

At a panel forum in December 2022, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes revealed that the first 10 months of the Ukraine war consumed as many Javelin missiles as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin produced in five years and as many Stinger missiles as the firm produced in 13 years.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October 2022, Hayes said the organization was doing good business.

Washington’s Ukraine SpendingThe United States has so far allocated $113 billion in assistance to Ukraine, of which $24.2 billion has been used for security assistance since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

The massive U.S. spending on the Ukraine war has attracted criticism from some Republicans. Last month, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) argued that those funds could have benefited U.S. citizens.

On Jan. 19, the Pentagon announced $2.5 billion in additional assistance to Kyiv, with plans to send 59 Bradley fighting vehicles, 90 Stryker combat vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition."
EN_UA_300066.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"WH: Support for Ukraine Still Strong, Despite Progressives' Letter to Biden 

 The White House said Tuesday that United States' support for Ukraine's war efforts would ""remain strong,"" despite the Congressional Progressive Caucus's signed memo urging President Joe Biden to establish diplomatic talks with Russia.

""Our support for Ukraine will remain strong until the end of this war,"" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

On Monday, the House Progressives signed a letter challenging Biden's handling of Ukraine and requested the White House engage in diplomacy discussions with Russia, in hopes of ending the ongoing war between the neighboring countries.

And earlier today, amid backlash from other congressional Democrats, the Progressives rescinded their memo-driven request to the Biden White House.

Regarding the White House's role in Ukraine and Russia theoretically ending the war, minus more violence or destruction, Jean-Pierre said that's up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — and not the Biden administration.

""Our job, as we see it today, as we've seen it for this past year — more than a year — is to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs on the ground, as we see this war happening in Ukraine,"" said Jean-Pierre.

""We're doing this to strengthen their hand, not just on the battlefield, but if they choose, if Ukraine chooses to negotiate,"" she added.

According to The Hill, the House Progressives had been working on their bold political stance since the summer, but waited to craft a public notice until a sizable number of total Democrats signed on for the call to action.

That rationale unwittingly fueled the uproar among congressional Democrats.

""They waited to get about 30 [people] and released,"" one anonymous source texted The Hill on Tuesday, without going into greater detail about the sensitivity of internal negotiations. ""Didn't consider election timing.""

As Newsmax chronicled Tuesday, the House Progressives' memo offered initial praise to Biden for providing financial and logistical support to Ukraine's self-defense efforts.

However, the CPC also demanded ""vigorous"" diplomatic efforts in support of a negotiated settlement and ceasefire, through ""direct talks with Russia.""

And that included certain measures to protect a ""free and independent"" Ukraine, according to reports.

The Republicans have yet to offer a formal response to reports of internal Democrat disagreements over the last two days.

However, that didn't preclude Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also the CPC chairwoman, from deflecting some heat toward GOP leadership.

""Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over,"" said Jayapal, referring to recent remarks from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., pledging that a GOP-controlled House would not give a ""blank check"" to Ukraine."

 BRITISH troops will join Nato forces in Europe to help defend Ukraine if Russia dares to invade, Boris Johnson vowed last night.

The defiant PM warned that any incursion will spark the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War Two and “many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home”.

Mr Johnson said the UK and its allies would respond swiftly and “in unison” to any invasion and with severe economic sanctions.

He added: “The British Army leads the Nato battle group in Estonia and if Russia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments to protect our allies in Europe.”

They are unlikely to be combat troops but ministers refused to rule anything out.

Members of the Nato alliance — including Denmark, Spain, Bulgaria and the Netherlands — are sending more fighter jets and warships to Eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region.

The US has also put 8,500 troops on alert to deploy at short notice, which Russia said caused it “great concern”.

It came as ex-MI6 chief Sir Alex Younger warned he could not see a scenario where Russian President Vladimir Putin “can back down in a way that satisfies the expectations that he has created”.


But the former spy chief added that Mr Putin has rejected “the only reasonable compromise” of proposed arms controls and sees a free Ukraine as “an affront” to his dream of rebuilding Russia.

Mr Putin continues to deny he plans to invade Ukraine.

But he has a strike force assembled in the region, which includes 127,000 troops, war jets, battleships, missile batteries, artillery and drones.

His forces have also been conducting training drills on land, sea and air.

Meanwhile, Britain’s Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said “significant numbers” of Russian advance forces have already crossed the border as spies.

Missions include covert reconnaissance of key targets for destruction and intelligence gathering on which populations will support and which will resist an invasion.

Airspace above Ukraine is expected to shut down within days as tensions soar.

Last night, a Russian senator vowed to cut off Europe’s gas in response to Mr Johnson’s threat of “coordinated and severe economic sanctions heavier than anything we have done before against Russia”.

Vice Speaker Nikolay Zhuravlev said Moscow would also starve Europe of oil and metal exports if it was barred from using the Swift international payment system, in a move backed by the US and Britain but opposed by Germany.

And MPs warned that war could trigger hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing west into the EU.

Tory MP Karl McCartney told the Commons yesterday that an EU “distracted and full of infighting” and unable to respond may be “part of Putin’s thinking”.

He warned: “If this massive flow of refugees happens, it may well be the end of the EU.”"

 Russia’s attack on Ukraine, including regular barrages of rockets, has boosted demand for Lockheed Martin missile defense systems, the No. 1 U.S. weapons maker said on Tuesday.

“We’ve got demand signals for THAAD and PAC-3 from around the world,” Chief Executive Jim Taiclet said after Lockheed reported a drop in quarterly sales and profits. THAAD and PAC-3 refers to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system and the interceptors for Patriot missile systems.

“Especially when you see missiles hitting hospitals and situations like that, and train stations in Ukraine,” Taiclet said in explaining the demand, adding that governments were now thinking “that it’s worthwhile to have an effective missile defense capacity in your country.”

Lockheed said its quarterly revenue fell while quarterly profits dropped 5.7 percent as supply chain woes triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic were compounded by inflation pressure.

The company reaffirmed its full-year revenue outlook of about $66 billion, which is in line with analysts estimates.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion was unveiled in March as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spurred demand for more military spending globally.

The pandemic crippled many aerospace companies’ ability to procure as well as supply parts needed to produce products, creating shortages, reducing inventories and hammering profits amid a period of rising inflation. Lockheed’s dual-use suppliers that cater to both commercial aviation and defense markets have also been impacted. Taiclet said inflation had hurt the company’s performance.

“The result should bring a focus to defense supply chain concerns, which may be evident elsewhere this quarter as well, though there did not seem to be major issues. In addition, management did not change 2022 guidance and with defense budget support and the war in Ukraine” raising defense spending appetites, temporary challenges could be limited, JP Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.

Shares in Lockheed were down $5.33, or 1.1 percent, at $462.21 at midday.

Lockheed’s Aeronautics unit, its biggest, which makes F-35 fighter jets saw its revenue rise 2 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, but profits fell by 2 percent to $697 million.

Lockheed reported 26 F-35 jet deliveries in the quarter compared with 17 a year earlier. Taiclet said Lockheed was working to increase F-35 sales for 2023.

Net earnings fell to $1.73 billion, or $6.44 per share, in the first quarter ended March 27 from $1.84 billion, or $6.56 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales fell about 8 percent to $14.96 billion in the quarter.

During the quarter Lockheed abandoned its proposed $4.4 billion purchase of rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc after antitrust regulators sued to block the deal."

Russia is mocking the United States’ insistence on funding Ukraine while in massive amounts of debt. Washington continues to throw billions of dollars into the fire of the Ukraine conflict despite its ballooning debt, Russia’s ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov has said.

The U.S. empire is becoming the laughing stock of the world over its insistence on pushing war and death for profit. Antonov made the comments after Washington approved a new tranche of aid to Kiev on the day when its debt reached a new milestone of $35 trillion.

Monday’s announcement by the Pentagon said that the U.S. will send an additional $1.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine because of an “accounting error” that somehow allows for more military spending. The ruling class can’t solve the inflation problem, but they can always find funding for war.

The Ruling Class, Now $35 Trillion In Debt, Finds Another $2 Billion For Ukraine

”Washington continues to burn colossal money in the furnace of the Ukraine conflict, and it does so in the face of record levels of US government debt,” the diplomat told journalists. “One can only imagine what good the resources pumped into the neo-Nazi and terrorist Kiev regime would do if they were spent on peaceful needs, on development, and on addressing the multiple social and economic issues” at home, mused Antonov.

Stop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War

Russia has also said that American weapons are not capable of turning around the situation on the battlefield and will only prolong the conflict and lead to more casualties, including among civilians. Historically, the U.S. hasn’t much cared about how many deaths result from its war mongering, as long as war is ongoing. It’s important to note that this is the disturbing reality of the ruling class we are being subjugated by.

“Looking back in history, it must be admitted that these lands are the ancient ancestral lands of the Jewish Khazaria, that is Israel, captured by Kiev’s Rus’ (the ancient state of Russia with the capital in Kiev) in the tenth century. The Slavs are temporary guests on these lands and are subject to eviction. We will return this territory, and build the Great Khazaria – the Jewish state –on these fertile lands the same way as, 50 years ago, we created Israel, squeezing the Palestinians out. Israelis will partially relocate here, and we will drive the Slavic cattle out far to the north, beyond Moscow. There will be a small Northern Territory, a reservation with a compact population — a reservation, like Indian reservations in America.”

— Quote from Menachem Mendel Schneerson, American Orthodox rabbi and foremost leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement

The preceding quote, uttered by the most revered and powerful leader of the modern Chabad Movement within Judaism, tells the whole story.

The Ukraine War was actually started by the Zio-Anglo-American Axis to fulfill the main prophecy implied by Schneerson’s series of apocalyptic statements.

With this critical understanding, it ought to be much easier to comprehend that the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster was stealthily executed as a nuclear terrorist attack … … … and by all the usual Khazarian suspects.
1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster:
An Apocalyptic Terrorist Act of Epic Proportions

The previous link contains Internet pathways to all of the conclusive scientific evidence necessary which proves that the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was carried out as a covert terror attack by the Western Powers against Russia.

For anyone who still has any doubt about this revised history, the following exposé clearly spells out the true purpose and perpetrators of that egregious crime against humanity committed at Russia’s Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986.
Chernobyl was a terrorist attack.
Now, fast forward to 2022.

What the whole world is now witnessing in Ukraine today — in the fog of that meticulously engineered war — is yet another scheme to carry out a nuclear terror event in order to fulfill the odious predictions of rogue rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.  It could even be posited that the Ukraine War was purposefully provoked to set the stage for a long-planned and rapidly evolving nuclear terror event.  As follows:

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and among the 10 largest in the world
Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station

Every day that goes by, the Khazarian nuclear terrorist group gets closer and closer to deliberately triggering the greatest nuclear catastrophe of the Third Millennium at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, as a prelude to starting World War III.

There are obviously several objectives to be accomplished by triggering such a “Nuclear Armageddon”.  Not only do the Khazarian perpetrators intend to force the Ukrainians off  and far away from their ancestral lands, especially the Russian speakers, they also want to establish the “New Israel” there as articulated by Schneerson.

Russian units have been carrying out successful offensive operation in the Kupyansk sector amid the inability of forces of the Kyiv regime to achieve any declared tasks and objectives of their ‘counter-offensive’ in Zaporozhye and South Donetsk. Earlier, Russian detachments also made a series of tactical advances south of Adeevka and in the area of Marrinka in the countryside of Donetsk.

These developments on the frontline took place amid the long-expected death of the grain deal under the shelter of which the Kyiv regime and its sponsors used the Odessa port infrastructure for military purposes. 

Apart from these actions, the West sabotaged the implementation of the part of the deal related to the Russian interests. Therefore, the fate of the deal was de-facto predetermined from its very start. The recent series of massive attacks aimed against the Republic of Crimea and the Crimean Bridge became a logical continuation of this approach.

In such conditions, Russia carried out a series of strikes on military objects placed within the Odessa port infrastructure. 

On July 18, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a group strike with precision sea-based weapons against facilities involved in preparations of attacks with unmanned boats as well as a ship repair plant near Odessa, where these boats were manufactured or at least partly assembled. 

Additionally, storage facilities with a total of about 70,000 tonnes of fuel were destroyed close to Nikolayev and Odessa. These facilities were used to supply fuel for the military hardware of the armed forces of the Kyiv regime. On the next day, on July 19, the Russian military delivered another round of strikes on such targets. E

xplosions were reported in the countryside of Odessa, including the Illichevsk port area where a large fuel storage depot was allegedly destroyed. Other sources claim that strikes also hit positions of Ukrainian air defense facilities in the Radujniy area.

The cost of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal and strikes on the Odessa port infrastructure for Kyiv and its puppeteers already exceeded any damage suffered by Russia from terrorist attacks aimed against Crimea. 

Nonetheless, NATO HQs demonstrate little ability to draw conclusions from observed reality. On July 19, Crimean authorities shut down a local highway and ordered the evacuation of about 2,200 people from four settlements in the east of the peninsula. The decision was made after an ammunition depot in the area close to the evacuated villages “caught fire”. 

Reports say that the fire was caused by a strike launched by the Kyiv regime. NATO-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were allegedly employed. 

By such actions, NATO and Kyiv have been consistently pushing Russia to the long-delayed but needed decisions regarding the elimination of military infrastructure in Odessa and nearby areas."

 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a grim outlook on the global economic during the World Economic Forum’s 2023 summit in Davos, Switzerland, warning of a possible worldwide economic downturn.

Citing the “perfect storm” of the Russia–Ukraine war, high food prices, and high energy costs, Guterres said that there will be “huge economic consequences” around the world. He did not predict, however, when the slowdown would start.

Guterres noted that economies outside the United States, Europe, and Asia would face worsening economic conditions. Developing countries in Africa, South America, and much of Asia are seeing rising interest rates, he noted.

“Interest rates are going up extremely in the global south. Countries are close to default. They have no resources because they couldn’t print money like the United States did, like Europe did during the COVID-19 [pandemic],” the UN chief told Bartiromo. “They have no access to concessional funding because many of them are middle-income countries. Look at small island developing states, the Caribbean islands.”

Some of those countries, he added, “lived on tourism” and “tourism has ended for two years, but as they are middle-income countries, they had no debt to live, they had no concessional funding.”

Guterres said that the United Nations is proposing a global stimulus plan to address economic woes, and claimed that economies should transition from oil and gas to other energy sources. “We need to do that in a just way,” he said, adding that “this transition needs to be well-managed.”

Meanwhile, the West and China need to have “serious” negotiations amid the dim global economic outlook, said the UN chief.

Other WarningsWhile inflation has eased at the consumer and producer level in the United States in recent months, a number of economists and business leaders say that Americans should prepare for a recession starting in 2023. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest levels in decades in order to cool high inflation that reached more than 9 percent in June 2022, though it has since dropped to below 7 percent.

“Some economists argue that the strength of the labor market—as well as household balance sheets—will keep the economy strong enough to avoid a recession,” wrote Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, for CNN’s website. “We disagree,” they wrote, saying that “it remains our expectation that the U.S. economy will enter a recession this year.”

“I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a memo on company’s website on Wednesday.

Other tech firms, such as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Twitter, have announced similar moves in recent weeks. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, had 221,000 full-time employees as of June 30, 2022, according to government filings."

 A pair of U.S. Air Force B52 strategic bombers on Monday flew low over the Croatian resort of Dubrovnik and three other NATO-member states in the region as a sign of support amid the Russian aggression in Ukraine.

In addition to the walled Croatian tourist resort of Dubrovnik, the aircraft flew over the government headquarters in Skopje, North Macedonia, the downtown Skanderbeg Square in the Albanian capital, Tirana, and up the Adriatic coast of Montenegro.

The Balkans and the Adriatic Sea have lately seen increased military, intelligence and propaganda activity by Moscow, which considers the region of its strategic interest because of its access to the Mediterranean.

“The purpose of each flyover is to demonstrate U.S. commitment and assurance to NATO allies and partners located in southeastern Europe,” the U.S. Air Force said in a statement. “Additionally, this will provide citizens an opportunity to take photos, videos, and enjoy the aircraft flying overhead.”

Crowds gathered on the squares in Skopje and Tirana, and tourists watched in Dubrovnik and Montenegro as the giant bombers thundered overhead. Some onlookers waved American flags.

North Macedonia was the last nation to join NATO in 2020 and Montenegro did it in 2017, both despite strong opposition from Russia.

North Macedonia’s Army Chief of Stuff, Lt. Colonel Jovan Azmanovski, told TV broadcaster Kanal 5 that the bombers’ flights were symbolic proof that “our skies are safe.”

“People in North Macedonia were able to see a flights of USAF B52 two strategic bombers over Skopje, which demonstrate our NATO membership and the safety and security of our and skies of entire alliance. Our skies are safe and our (NATO) membership is more than visible,” Azmanovski said.

In Tirana, Albanian Army Chief of Staff Arben Kingji said “we are witnessing a strategic military demonstration.""

“Our strategic partners are hand to hand with us, it’s a message of unity,"" he said at the square where people gathered.

The two B-52 Stratofortress aircraft are assigned to the 23rd Bomb Squadron currently operating out of RAF Fairford, United Kingdom.

Since 2018, the U.S. has conducted more than 200 Bomber Task Force sorties with allies and partners.

Most recently, this involved B-1B Lancer flights over the Nordic, Baltic, and Black Sea regions in May, as well as an air policing overflight of North Macedonia in June. In June, Stratofortresses conducted flights over the Arctic Ocean, and later took part in BALTOPS, the largest annual exercise in the Baltic Sea.

In the Baltic Sea, the amphibious warship USS Kearsarge -- the largest warship ever to visit Lithuania — was officially welcomed Monday. The country borders fellow NATO member Poland and Belarus, a Moscow ally.

On Monday, the NATO air police mission in Lithuania reported that jets were scrambled four times last week to identify and escort Russian war planes, which violated rules of international airspace.

Ukraine and the West have resorted to false flag operations to persuade everyone that ISIS* was behind the terror attack in the Crocus City Hall concert venue near Moscow, said Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Sputnik's parent media group Rossiya Segodnya.

The head of the media group stressed that the names and faces of the perpetrators are already known to authorities and that the terrorists gave everything away during interrogation.

“It immediately became obvious why US media were claiming in unison that it was ISIS,"" she said.

Simonyan explained that the perpetrators were chosen to carry out the attack in a manner that would allow the West to persuade the international community that ISIS was behind the attack.

“Basic sleight of hand. The level of a railway thimble-rigger,"" she added."" It has nothing to do with ISIS. It's Ukrainians.""

She added that the enthusiasm displayed by Western media when they tried to persuade everyone that ISIS was responsible even before arrests were made gave them away completely.

“This is not ISIS. This is a well-coordinated team of several other, also widely known, abbreviations,"" Simonyan concluded.

The shooting occurred on Friday evening in the Crocus City Hall concert venue just outside Moscow and was followed by a massive fire, claiming at least 143 lives.

In the hours following the attack, Western media insisted that radical jihadist organization ISIS was behind it, while Ukrainian officials also said that they had nothing to do with the tragedy.

However, suspects were detained in Russia's Bryansk region near Ukrainian border. According to the data provided by law enforcing agencies, they had a support base on the other side of the border.

Moreover, while Kiev rushed to deny its involvement into the shooting, Ukrainian secret services have a long track record of terror attacks on Russian territory, from shelling in the Belgorod region to assassinations of political scientist Daria Dugina and journalist Vladlen Tatarsky.

*ISIS (also known as Daesh/ISIL/IS/Islamic State) is a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries."

 Germany's ex-interior minister lashes out at government's political stance on Ukraine-Russia conflict

Otto Schily was one of the founding members of the Greens Party in 1980, but then joined the Social Democrats (SPD) nine years later. Today, the former German interior minister is sharply criticising his former parties regarding their stance on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the management of the economy and the direction energy policy has taken.

Former German Interior Minister Otto Schily cautioned against the dangers of Germany taking an unilateral course in the Ukraine conflict, while at the same time clearly arguing in favour of war. „A bellicosity has developed in Germany, which is risky,” Mr Schily told the German Press Agency.

“The Greens, of all people, are too one-sided. There is too little thought about how we can get out of the conflict,”

said the former Social Democrat politician, emphasizing that he unreservedly condemns the war and the bloodshed it brings. He added that instead of deepening the conflict, the German federal government should be seeking to find other prospects for Ukraine besides being sent money and weapons. Constructive ideas and political imagination are needed, he said.

Mr Schily also told the press agency how he sees the tense situation that has unfolded:

„Ukraine wants to remain independent. Everyone has to acknowledge that. At the same time it must be clear that one has to live with one’s neighbours, including with Russia. Both sides have interests that must be taken into account. Russia will always remain a factor, also with regard to Europe. We have to find a way to deal with the Russians.”

Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s interior minister believes that it would not be a good move for Ukraine to join NATO. He pointed out that Ukraine’s multilingualism, including the Russian language, is an indisputable fact. Taking a look at other countries shows that the interests of all sides can be safeguarded if a country remains militarily neutral. Mr Schily also sees Ukraine’s accession to the EU as unrealistic and recommends that Ukraine follow the „Swiss model”.

Switzerland is an excellent example of „how to develop a free society with mutual respect for the different ethnic backgrounds and with military neutrality. Ukraine could take Switzerland as an example,”

he said, adding that he doesn’t see “how Ukraine’s accession to the EU could work without the EU overstretching.”

Mr Schily expressly warned that the German government should not overburden the country economically. He also criticised the three-party coalition government because even amidst the energy crisis, they fail to realise how unwise it is to phase out nuclear power just because the Greens insist on it.

“Now it’s becoming even clearer that completely giving up on nuclear technology was foolish. The total abandonment of nuclear technology has placed us in a very precarious economic situation. Due to the simultaneous phase-out of nuclear power and coal, Germany has become reliant on natural gas,”

he pointed out."

This is a war between democracy and autocracy.

While I agree that Russia is an autocracy, Ukraine is also an autocracy. Zelensky has banned his opposition, shutdown independent media and arrested and tortured his political opponents.

The world’s autocracies include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, the Baltic states, Slovakia, Greece, Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany is one of the world’s leading police states and still uses the same Gestapo and Stasi tactics to crush its dissidents. The United States under Joe Biden is trending toward autocracy due to draconian censorship of social media and the expansion of the surveillance state and is only thwarted from moving further in that direction by the U.S. Constitution.

The difference between British autocracy and Russian autocracy is that you can be arrested and imprisoned in the UK for “misgendering” someone on Twitter.

 Kyiv: Russia is adapting simple bombs to include guidance systems, making them affordable and efficient alternatives to pricey guided missiles. Illia Ponomarenko of the Kyiv Independent claims that the UMPK (unified module for gliding and navigation) technologies appear to be turning ordinary bombs into intelligent ones. 

The enhanced guided or gliding bombs, according to Ponomarenko, present “an especially serious threat to Ukraine” and have the ability to “deliver devastating hits upon Ukrainian lines and the rear front.” According to the site, this device can be used to give Russia’s plentiful supply of outdated Soviet FAB-500M-62 gravity bombs “wings” and a basic satellite navigation system. Russian bombs that had been modified were successfully employed in March to strike Ukrainian defences in Avdiivka, Donetsk. According to Russian media, the production of the kit costs less than 2 million roubles, or about $24,000, making it significantly less expensive than buying missiles and other weaponry from abroad. 

In contrast, one Kalibr cruise missile, which Russia used frequently in its invasion of Ukraine, costs just under $6.5 million. The JDAM-ER kits, which turn existing unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, were given by the US to Ukraine, and they are identical to the system. Although Russia has not acknowledged making the UMPK kits in substantial quantities, this would be a practical substitute for pricey cruise and ballistic missiles, the stock of which is already largely exhausted. 

According to estimations from the Ukrainian air force, these weapons can have an effective range of more than 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, the Kyiv Independent said. According to the article, the Ukrainian air force calculates that up to 20 guided bomb hits are made every day along the front line by Russian Su-34 and Sukhoi Su-35 aircraft that are launched from higher heights. 

Ukraine must use air defence systems like the S-300 to fend off the jets in order to stop the Russian attack. According to recently released Pentagon documents, Kyiv’s supply of S-300 weapons is running low and may run out in May. On Wednesday, a number of Patriot missile defence systems sent by Western partners arrived in Ukraine. Additionally, Ukraine has been frantically searching for more ammo for its air defence systems, which have been essential to protect against Russian planes. 

As its Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 are obsolete and do not have contemporary longer-range air-to-air missiles, Ukraine has also been pleading for its Western friends to supply fighter jets to protect against Russian assaults.

The Washington Post has recently revealed the long-known fact that the Ukrainian special services are behind the terrorist attacks on Russian territory. Moreover, Ukrainian terrorists were praised for progress they made during the years-long cooperation with their partners in the US. Inspired by fame, the Kiev regime doubled its efforts to launch more attacks against the Russians. In recent days alone, a lot of the attacks failed but some were partially successful.

On the morning of October 27, pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsarev was targeted with an assassination attempt in Crimea. He was shot and hospitalized with heavy wounds. The victim has been a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine since 2002. In 2014, he supported the referendum on independence in Donbass and served as the speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya.

Unfortunately, Oleg Tsarev was far from the first victim of the Nazi Kiev regime, which has been hunting for politicians, journalists and public figures because of their positions for more than a decade.

Kiev also continues attempts to launch terrorist attacks in various cities of Russia. Their goals are to inflict civilian casualties and threaten the population, as well as to discredit the Russian authorities and create the appearance of a national resistance against the Kremlin. To do this, Kiev recruits naive men, often Ukrainians who have moved to Russia, who for monetary rewards go to a life of crime and sacrifice their lives.

On October 26, the FSB announced the elimination of a Ukrainian agent who wanted to stage a terrorist attack on one of the military enlistment offices in Tver.

The man was a member of some “Ukrainian nationalist formation”. He provided Kiev with data on military, fuel and energy facilities in the region. During the arrest, the man resisted and was killed. The FSB seized homemade explosives and an RGD-5 grenade on the spot.

Military enlistment offices are frequently targeted by the Ukrainian special services. Kiev is trying to create the appearance that Russian men do not want to fight and resist the Kremlin’s policies.

Cases have become frequent when Ukrainian scammers under various pretexts forced women to set fire to military enlistment offices in different Russian cities. For example, victims were assured that they should stage the attack to check the effectiveness of local emergency services and so on.

Sometimes Kiev shows more ingenuity to assure Washington that the years of training and funding have not passed for nothing.

For example, a Ukrainian who has been living with his family in Moscow for many years recently tried to poison Russian pilots. Disguised as a courier, he delivered a poisoned cake to their holiday. However, the operation failed, and now the Ukrainian agent will be arrested in a criminal case. Meanwhile, his Ukrainian and American curators will have to search for more naive victims in Russia."

Pentagon bean-counters now claim that an ‘accounting error’ may have resulted in Kiev being supposedly shortchanged of billions in US weapons and ammunition.

Kiev’s money pit: the billion dollar grift just got that much more corrupt…

The US Department of Defense has discovered an accounting error that could result in even more weapons, ammunition and equipment being available for Ukraine than previously thought, Reuters reported on Thursday.

The agency cited a Senate aide and a Pentagon official – both anonymous – who said that the US military had “overestimated the value” of some of its hardware that was sent to Kiev by “around $3 billion.”

The Pentagon used the current replacement costs for equipment taken from its stocks, rather than factoring in the original purchase price and depreciation, according to the agency’s source. The DOD is reportedly taking steps to notify Congress of the “accounting adjustment.”

Senator Roger Wicker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Reuters that the Pentagon made a “major mistake” that could underestimate future needs of NATO allies.

“Our priority should be a Ukrainian victory over [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. Unilaterally altering military aid calculations is an attempt at deception and undermines this goal,” said the senator from Mississippi.

However, the accounting confusion may translate into even more supplies to the Kiev government, according to the agency. As of Monday, the US was reportedly down to only $6 billion in Ukraine aid, from the $48 billion approved by Congress in December. Getting more funding approved is difficult at the moment, due to the standoff over the national debt ceiling.

Washington’s efforts to pump Kiev with weapons consist of two tracks. The Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) allows the Pentagon to send materiel from its own stockpiles – to the tune of $21.1 billion so far, in 37 separate packages. The separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) has the US government pay the military industry to make new weapons and ammunition, much of which has yet to arrive.

According to Reuters, the Pentagon sent a memo to all four service branches the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Marine Corps – on March 31, clarifying how the value of the equipment should be calculated. The anonymous Pentagon official speaking to the agency used the example of 155mm artillery shells, of which more than 1.5 million were sent to Kiev. While each costs about $800 today, the cost over several decades averages out to much less.

Ukraine has repeatedly said that its successes on the battlefield heavily depends on the aid from the West. According to Russian military estimates, the US and its allies had delivered over $100 billion worth of weapons and supplies to Ukraine by December 2022.

Moscow has warned Washington that this elevates the risk of direct confrontation. However, the US and NATO have insisted that arming Kiev does not actually make them a party to the conflict."

 The key witness in an investigation into the Biden crime family corruption and influence-peddling has gone missing and is feared dead just days before he was due to testify, according to Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer (R-KY).

According to Comer, his team has been unable to reach the FBI informant who alleged corruption by Biden and his family, after the bureau dodged a subpoena last week demanding a report detailing allegations that he took bribes while vice president.

“Well, unfortunately, we can’t track down the informant. We’re hopeful that the informant is still there,” Comer told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” Comer also said a whistleblower communicating with the committee about the alleged bribery scheme “knows the informant” and is “credible.”

The People’s Voice had the scoop on the missing whistleblower last week. Watch:

Comer told Bartiromo that the Oversight Committee has identified a pattern of intimidation by the Biden White House.

“Nine of the ten people that we’ve identified that have very good knowledge with respect to the Bidens, they’re one of three things: They’re either currently in court; they’re currently in jail; or they’re currently missing,” said Comer.

He said others “want to come forward” about the first family’s history of influence peddling, but they “fear for their lives.”

“Not only are the Biden lawyers and the Biden White House intimidating them — the media is trying to intimidate and discredit them,” according to Comer, who went on to blast committee Democrats for their actions in the probe.

Comer also revealed further details about how the FBI dodged a subpoena demanding details about the corruption case. According to Comer, the whole thing stinks of a high-level cover up.

The FBI objected to handing over the FD-1023 informant report last week, informing the Oversight panel in a six-page letter that the information was “unverified” and may risk the confidentiality of agency sources.

“All we’re asking the FBI with respect to the form 1023 is, ‘What did you do to investigate this allegation?’ And they sent us back a very patronizing letter basically saying, ‘Just trust us and don’t worry about it,’” Comer said Sunday.

“This is a pattern of behavior by the FBI that would suggest there’s been a cover-up for many years with respect to the Biden influence-peddling.”

According to the subpoena, the report on the allegations was “created or modified in June 2020” — the same month that Biden clinched the Democratic presidential nomination — and alleges a “criminal scheme” involving “money for policy decisions.”

 The beginning of the special military operation went down in history for the lightning-fast march of the Russian Armed Forces to Kyiv. Russia eventually pulled its troops back from the capital of Ukraine. Sooner or later, however, the Russian forces will have to take Kyiv.

It will take the Russian forces more than just three days to take Kyiv. Interestingly, it was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, who voiced the ""Kyiv in three days” phrase a month before the start of the special operation.

According to him, if the Russian forces go on a full-scale invasion, Kyiv will fall in 72 hours.

Neither the Russian authorities nor the Russian military promised to ""take Kyiv in three days.”

Some believe, however, that this could be real. The Russian army had already approached Kyiv when the West and Ukraine began negotiations and convinced Moscow to ""withdraw troops” for the talks to be effective. As always, NATO and Ukraine did not keep their promises.

Since then, Kyiv has been keeping 120,000 Ukrainian troops in this direction in constant combat readiness. They did not even use any of those personnel for the defense of Avdiivka.

Ukraine is trying to play it safe — although it is clear that the Russian army is not going to take Kyiv without giving it a second thought.

Colonel Timur Syrtlanov, a special forces veteran, told Tsargrad publication that Russia would need to accomplish the following:

These are ""Putin four strikes,” by analogy with Stalin ""10 strikes.”

Russia has combat experience that it gained in Chechnya and Syria, and the Russian forces will be ""tormenting” the enemy by working in a targeted manner.

As for the operation in the very beginning of the armed conflict, the attempt to come to an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities was a big mistake, political scientist Dmitry Rodionov believes. There were expectations that Zelensky would flee on day two or day three за the special military operation.

The Russian forces should have taken not only Kyiv, but also Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. As a result, the expert believes, ""intelligence errors led to gestures of goodwill that no one appreciated.”

All illusions about the nature of the special military operation have also been dispelled as well. This is not just a regional problem, but a period of global redivision of the world.

The West will drag out the conflict for as long as possible because it is benefiting from it. Meanwhile, Russia is developing cooperation with many other countries bypassing sanctions and living its own life, but no one knows how long all this is going to last.

Ultimate goals are as follows:

""It's time for Russia to take advantage of this circumstance. It is too early to attack Kyiv directly, but it is possible and necessary to split this society from within,” experts conclude.

The Russian forces obliterated a batch of 25,000 155-mm NATO shells in the port of Odessa. Twelve armoured vehicles (Turkey) and a warehouse of unmanned boats were also destroyed"

House Speaker Mike Johnson’s newly unveiled foreign aid bill includes over $26 billion for Israel — $12 billion more than the previous bill which asked for $14 billion — $61 billion for Ukraine and absolutely nothing to secure America’s borders.

As Sen. Rand Paul notes, Johnson is also putting forward bills to ban TikTok (to silence criticism of Israel), turn American businesses into NSA spies and seize Russia’s assets to give to Ukraine in an act of war (the REPO Act).

Speaker Johnson and the Uniparty are united behind their laundry list of bad ideas. From borrowing $95 billion from China to send it to other countries to killing a FISA warrant requirement — they’re ticking all the boxes to put America last.

— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 17, 2024

From Reuters, “US House sets long-awaited vote on billions for Ukraine, Israel”:

The U.S. House of Representatives will have its long-awaited vote on aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific as soon as Saturday, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday, paving the way for its possible passage despite fierce objections from the right wing of his conference.

The House Appropriations Committee unveiled legislation providing more than $95 billion in security assistance, including $60.84 billion to address the conflict in Ukraine and assist regional partners as they handle Russia’s invasion, of which $23.2 billion would be used to replenish U.S. weapons, stocks and facilities.

The effort to pass security aid gained new urgency following Iran’s unprecedented attacks on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus on April 1.

The Israel bill totals $26.38 billion, some of which will cover the cost of U.S. military operations in response to recent attacks. And $9.1 billion of the total is designated for humanitarian needs, something Democrats had demanded for them to support the bill.

As a reminder, the Intercept reported on Monday that the U.S. — not Israel — shot down the majority of the drones and missiles Iran fired at Israel.

Reuters continues:

The Indo-Pacific measure totals $8.12 billion.

Johnson said he would give House members 72 hours from the bill’s introduction – until mid-day Saturday – to review the bill. He said the chamber would vote on final passage on Saturday evening.

He also said he would release a separate border security bill, meeting a demand from conservatives.

Democratic President Joe Biden said he strongly supported the package. He called on the House to pass it this week and the Senate to quickly follow. “I will sign this into law immediately to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends, and we won’t let Iran or Russia succeed,” Biden said in a statement.

This bill is literally worse than the one they tanked a few weeks ago."

 The Biden administration is very “concerned” that Russia might escalate its invasion of Ukraine and use nuclear weapons, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” Sullivan said the United States was monitoring Russia’s moves closely but noted that officials have not yet seen anything that would require them to change their “nuclear posture.”

“We are watching this extremely closely, and obviously, the escalation risk with a nuclear power is severe, and it is a different kind of conflict than other conflicts the American people have seen over the years,” Sullivan said.

“And the American President, Joe Biden, has to take that responsibility extremely seriously, even as we redouble our efforts to support the Ukrainians. As things stand today, the United States has not adjusted our nuclear posture, but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour, because it is a paramount priority to the president.”

When asked if the Biden administration was “concerned” about the situation, Sullivan said, “Anytime you have a nuclear power fighting in a conflict zone in Europe near NATO territory, of course we have to focus on and be concerned about the possibility of escalation, the risk of escalation.”

However, Sullivan again doubled down on his previous comment that officials “have not seen anything that would require us to change our nuclear posture at this time.”

Within days of invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert, blaming the “hostile actions” and statements of Western nations and NATO.

“Western countries are not only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic area. I’m speaking about the illegitimate sanctions that everyone is well aware of. However, the top officials of the leading NATO countries also make aggressive statements against our country as well,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top ministers.

As a result, Putin said that he has ordered “the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”

The deterrence forces include command of Russia’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, although it is unclear what a “special mode of combat duty” refers to.

Putin’s order means that Russia’s nuclear weapons are prepared for the increased possibility of launch, raising the possibility that Western nations could be subject to nuclear strikes if they get too involved in the Ukraine conflict.

However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 9 called Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine–Russia conflict a “bluff.”

On March 13, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators said that there had been progress in talks between both sides regarding a potential end to the conflict.

The Kyiv government is continuing to demand an “end of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, wrote on Twitter, adding that he believes Ukraine will “achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”

While both sides appear to be optimistic about the potential to end the more than two-week-long conflict, no further details were provided."

 An attorney for former President Donald Trump wants the 51 former intelligence chiefs held responsible for backing Hunter Biden in the unfolding story of the laptop abandoned in a Delaware repair shop.

Lawyer Tim Parlatore's goal is to uncover alleged communications between the 51 former senior intel leaders and the Biden 2020 campaign.

Politico had reported that an Oct. 19, 2020, letter, signed by the former intelligence officials, outlined their assessment that a New York Post disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden ""has all the classic earmarks of a Russia information operation.""

Those signing the letter included former CIA Directors Leon Panetta, Mike Hayden and John Brennan, along with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

The letter offered no evidence, but raised suspicions by the former intel officials.

The Post had previously reported that during the final months of the heated 2020 presidential race between Joe Biden and Trump, there were emails showing evidence of a possible meeting in the past between Hunter Biden, his father, and a Ukrainian energy firm linked to corruption. Joe Biden denied the meeting described took place.

In March of this year, The New York Times backed up portions of the Post's reporting on the Hunter Biden emails.

""Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,"" the Times reported.

Now, Parlatore has filed letters of complaint with the agencies that had employed the 51 former intel officials.

The letters cite ""an egregious breach"" by former agency employees ""that appears to have been overlooked by your agency, as it has gone uninvestigated and certainly unpunished. Specifically, the unauthorized publication and dissemination of an intelligence assessment, purportedly based on classified information that was used wrongfully to influence the outcome of an election.""

According to a Post opinion piece by journalist Miranda Devine, letters were sent to John Hollister Hedley, chairman of the Publication Classification Review Board at the CIA; Gen. Paul Nakasone, director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command; Christine Abizaid, director of the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Caroline Krass, general counsel, Department of Defense; and Avril Haines, director of the Information Management Division in the Office of the DNI.

Parlatore wants each agency to ""proceed immediately with legal action to [ensure] that such breaches of vital security provisions do not continue to go unchecked, the Post said.

His letter notes that each of the 51 former officials was ""bound by the lifelong obligation"" to submit the letter to their former agencies for pre-publication security review.

Parlatore is also expected to file a letter with the Federal Election Commission asking that the letter signed by the 51 former officials be considered a campaign ""in-kind contribution.""

The Post noted that another step is for Parlatore to file a lawsuit as he seeks to establish a link between Democrat operatives and the controversial letter."

 Moscow: Some Russian officials including those working on Putin’s 2024 re-election campaign have been directed to immediately stop using iPhones as they are more at risk from hackers and espionage than other smartphones. 
According to separate reports published in the state newspapers - The Moscow Times and Kommersant, the workers have been told that they have until April 1, 2023 to either throw their iPhones or give them to children. As per reports, Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko issued the ‘Final word’ directive on iPhones on Monday. Those asked to abide were officials working in the presidential administration’s domestic policy, public projects, State Council, and IT departments. The directive took place during a seminar in the Moscow region earlier this month, according to the Russian newspaper, which cited sources present at the meeting. According to the Kommersant report which cited an unnamed source, officials have been instructed to replace even the finest iPhones with phones built on other smartphone software, such as Android, Chinese counterparts, or Aurora, an operating system developed by the Russian company Open Mobile Platform. 

It’s interesting that this is happening at a time when governments all over the world are removing China’s TikTok from their systems and networks due to similar worries. The Moscow Times reports that the rumored iPhone prohibition coincides with the Russian government’s efforts to wean its citizens away from Western technology by establishing a “sovereign mobile ecosystem” based on the Avrora operating system. One seminar attendee was quoted in the Kommersant report as saying, “It’s all over for the iPhone: either throw it away or give it to the children”. Besides this, the Kremlin officials are not allowed to use smartphones for any official reasons. “It makes no difference what they are. 

Regardless of the running system—Android or iOS—any smartphone is a fairly transparent device. Naturally, they are not utilized for formal functions,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The alleged directive, reports claim coincides with ongoing campaign planning for the forthcoming Russian presidential election in 2024. Apple ceased selling products to Russia a week after it invaded Ukraine last year. But a few months later, sources claimed that Russians were still using authorized parallel importation channels to buy the new iPhone 14. Russia allegedly legalised these import programs a few months into the conflict, allowing merchants to bring goods into the nation without the owner’s consent. 

It’s unknown whether all Russian government officials received the same advice to get rid of their Apple iPhones, despite reports that those within the Russian presidential administration were instructed to do so. A request for comment made prior to publication was not quickly answered by the Russian Federation’s embassy in the US. To the contrary, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for the Kremlin, advised reporters that “smartphones should not be used for official business,” according to Reuters. Apple is yet to respond on the issue. Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

 We talked about the players, we talked about the stakeholders, we talked about the politics. Now, let’s talk about the benefits. We know it sounds like a paradox. This is, after all, a war so who can possibly benefit? The defence industry.

Wars can lead to an increase in defence spending. The more prolonged and intense the conflict, the greater the demand. A government that is fighting a war will obviously spend more money. So, nations invest heavily in technology, in weaponry, and in infrastructure.

This heightened demand helps defence companies across the globe, and that causes stocks to rally. Take U.S. defence stocks for example. They have added $23 billion in market value since the war began. On Monday, Northrop Grumman soared by 12%, General Dynamics jumped 9%, Lockheed Martin gained 8% and RTX rallied 4%, and this is only expected to grow in the days ahead.

Take Lockheed Martin, for example. This company makes the F-35 fighter jets being used by the Israel military. They also make Black Hawk helicopters. Northrop Grumman makes combat vehicles. Israel uses all these weapons and will need more in the future. The U.S. will be sending more weapons to Israel in the coming days, so the stocks of these companies are expected to rally.

And this won’t be the first time this happens. Last year too, defence stocks got a huge boost when Russia invaded Ukraine. As of today, the US has spent over $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine, so the biggest beneficiary is the American defence sector and that is likely to be the case with this war too.

This is one of the harshest realities of war. For some people, wars cost lives and for others, they drive value. For defence companies wars act as economic stimulus, they bolster sales, they fuel job creation and sometimes they also boost local economies.

Now, of course, this does raise moral and ethical questions like: is this profiting from human suffering? More importantly: is this motivation to prolong a conflict? Plus, there is the investor dilemma: defence stocks are often called sin stocks, or warmonger investments.

But the label here doesn’t matter, these stocks surge massively during war and that makes them very attractive for investors. Currently, the world is dealing with two wars - the Ukraine war, and now, the Israel-Hamas war. Defence spending was already on the rise this year. Europe has ramped up military sending, the highest since the cold war. Asian nations have also bumped spending. Defence budgets of Japan and South Korea grew by 7% in 2022, India’s defence budget was $81.4 billion in 2022, a rise of 6% from 2021.

Currently, global military spending is at $2.24 trillion, which is 2.2% of the world’s GDP. Chances are it will only rise further in the coming days."

For those of you that have not been paying attention, the apocalyptic alliances that we have been anticipating for years have now formed.

“During a virtual meeting at the end of last year our leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin – TASS) came up with a plan for further development of bilateral relations. We are ready to join forces with the Russian side, in accordance with the high-level agreements, to decisively stand up for national interests and virtues, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas,” he said.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is preparing to visit Moscow for a summit with Russia’s president in the coming months, according to people familiar with the plan, as Vladimir Putin wages war in Ukraine and portrays himself as a standard-bearer against a U.S.-led global order.

 As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its grim second year, a new and ominous chapter has unfolded with the poisoning of Marianna Budanova, the wife of Ukraine’s spy chief, Kyrylo Budanov. This incident marks a disturbing turn in the ongoing hostilities between the two nations, raising questions about the methods employed and the potential infiltration of intelligence agencies.

The conflict has reached a virtual stalemate with both sides fortifying their positions as winter sets in. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s counteroffensive has stalled and Russia maintains its occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine. As the war approaches its two-year mark, tensions continue to escalate.

F-16 factor

The focus now shifts to the military strategies employed by both sides. Ukraine is placing its hopes on the acquisition of F-16 fighter jets with expectations of receiving the first batch before the new year. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be resorting to covert tactics introducing the alarming element of poison into the conflict.

The use of poison, a notorious tool in Putin’s arsenal to silence critics, has now found its way to the Ukrainian battlefield. Marianna Budanova has become the first known target of this insidious method. Reports indicate that the Ukrainian intelligence unit G-U-R, responsible for the country’s security, has confirmed her poisoning along with several other officials, all now hospitalised.

The aftermath of Marianna Budanova’s poisoning raises serious questions about a potential breach in Ukraine’s intelligence unit. Accusations are being thrown between the two nations with Russia placing blame on Ukraine citing it as a case of infighting. This incident sheds light on the vulnerability of high-profile Ukrainian leaders and their families.

Kyrylo Budanov: A targeted spy chief

Kyrylo Budanov, a 37-year-old Lieutenant General and chief of Ukraine’s main spy agency since 2020, has been a thorn in Moscow’s side. Known for orchestrating attacks deep inside Russian territory, Budanov has survived at least 10 assassination attempts including a botched car bombing in 2019. His actions have made him a hate figure in Russia further escalating tensions.

Moscow has levied charges against Budanov, linking his unit to the killings of pro-war Russian figures, including Vladlen Tatarsky, a blogger, and Darya Dugina, a journalist and the daughter of a close ally of Putin. These charges make Budanov a prime target for Russian agencies.

History of covert poisoning in Russia

The use of poison as a weapon is not new in Russian tactics. Notable victims include Alexei Navalny, Putin’s vocal opposition politician currently serving a 30-year jail term, and the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London. The recurring theme of poisoning critics underscores the ruthless methods employed by Russian intelligence.

The poisoning of Marianna Budanova adds a sinister dimension to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As the war rages on, the international community watches with concern, grappling with the use of poison as a tool of war. The incident raises urgent questions about the safety of high-profile individuals and the potential infiltration of intelligence units, further complicating an already volatile situation."

The US and EU on Friday are piling on fresh anti-Russia sanctions as the war in Ukraine reaches two years (Saturday marking the date of the invasion) and in the wake of Alexei Navalny's death in prison last week, which Russia has officially said was due to ""natural causes"".

The US Treasury Department on Friday is unveiling over 500 new sanctions on Russia and industries connected to war sector. It's being hailed the single largest tranche of penalties slapped on Moscow since the war's start. This included export restrictions imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.

""The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine,"" President Biden said in a statement which first unveiled the planned sanctions. ""If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going. And the costs to the United States — along with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world — will rise.""

Biden has further said the fresh action ""will ensure"" President Putin ""pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home."" Washington has also sought to target individuals and entities connected with Navalny's imprisonment.

The new Friday statement prepared by the White House additionally stated, ""Two years ago, he tried to wipe Ukraine off the map. If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going.""

As for ""paying the price"" - just as Biden issued these words, The Wall Street Journal observed that two years after the invasion, the ""biggest ever"" sanctions are failing and have failed:

Two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Western sanctions have failed in their most important task—stopping the Kremlin’s war machine.

Western officials and experts say the financial, economic, military and energy sanctions imposed on Russia since February 2022 have damaged Russia’s economy and arms-production capacity, and will create serious problems for the Kremlin in the coming years. But they acknowledge the restrictions have hit more slowly than they hoped.

The report further acknowledges the merely symbolic nature of the new sanctions: ""U.S. officials privately concede that the new measures set to to be announced Friday are likely to land a limited blow.""

 U.S. and Ukrainian officials, as well as medics, soldiers, and international researchers, claim Russia is increasing its use of toxic gases on the battlefield is increasing as it escalates an offensive designed to seize more of Ukraine's territory than the roughly 20% it already occupies.

Last month, Ukrainian soldiers were encamped in a front-line dugout and under siege from Russian drones dropping grenades, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Although there were no explosions when the first bombs landed, a strong smell of chlorine filled the air. The soldiers felt their skin sting, eyes water, and lungs fill with smoke, provoking a hard cough.

They placed rags soaked with water over their faces as the heavy gas filled the air. Oleksiy Bozhko, a volunteer medic whose team examined the men near the eastern city of Avdiivka, identified the gas as chloropicrin, a banned chemical irritant, based on the men's symptoms and descriptions of the smell, the Journal reported.

""This weapon cripples and kills, it's indiscriminate,"" Bozhko said.

The U.S. announced sanctions earlier this month against Russian companies and government bodies involved in the creation and supply of chemical weapons used at the front lines in Ukraine, singling out chloropicrin. The chemical agent, sometimes used in pesticides, was weaponized during World War I and is banned for use in battle by the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Russia is a signatory.

After the U.S. sanctions announcement, the Journal reported, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called accusations that troops used toxic gases ""baseless,"" saying, ""Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area."" The Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry didn't immediately respond to requests from the Journal for comment.

Dan Kaszeta, an expert on chemical weapons and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, told the Journal chloropicrin is toxic to humans and animals, but also acts as an irritant.

Depending on the level of exposure, the gas can burn skin, irritate tear ducts, and make it difficult to breathe, let alone defend against incoming attacks. Kaszeta told the Journal the chemical has been surpassed by more modern agents sometimes used by riot police as tear gas, known as CN and CS, which are also banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Capt. Dmytro Serhiyenko, assistant to the commander of the Analytical Center of the Ukrainian Army's Support Forces, which analyzes chemical weapon use on the front lines, told the Journal all three of those agents are used by Russia on the battlefield. Although his team has mostly logged uses of CN and CS in the areas they track, they also found two grenades containing chloropicrin at abandoned Russian positions.

Ukrainians have been tracking the use of chemical weapons at the front since February 2023, the Journal reported, and the number of confirmed incidents has steadily increased. As of May 3, the Support Forces have confirmed 1,891 such attacks since they began tracking data, including 444 in April, an increase of 71 confirmed incidents from March. These numbers are incomplete because it isn't possible to get to the location where a gas was used to collect a sample or interview soldiers because of the intensity of the fighting."

Biden faces an array of steep challenges as he tries to safe the cash. The Home stays in chaos as a result of the Republican majority has been unable to pick a speaker to exchange Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted greater than two weeks in the past.

Discussions on giving interim Home Speaker Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the authority to handle legislative affairs and conduct flooring votes — an unprecedented transfer — have intensified because the Home is and not using a everlasting chief at a vital time for Congress.

Biden’s speech shall be delivered from the Oval Workplace at 8:00 pm ET.

Biden’s earlier prime-time addresses to the nation included when the U.S. narrowly averted a nationwide debt default and on the anniversary of coronavirus lockdowns. His first was to deal with the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was discovered responsible of murdering George Floyd."

 Great Reset Currency Collapse! - Russia Has Gold Standard - Inflation Hits Record High! WAM

Josh Sigurdson talks with Tim Picciott, The Liberty Advisor about the highest rate of inflation in history if you go by the unofficial numbers as Russia switches to a gold standard to get around sanctions and the US dollar appears to be ready for a complete collapse.

This is the perfect power move for the global establishment. Yes, the US dollar needs to collapse one way or another, but the switch which is being aided by China and Russia will see a massive power shift to ANOTHER establishment world order headed by China. THERE we will see the largest move towards technocracy in the history of the world and perhaps the most dangerous anti-human revolution in human history as well.

THIS is the great reset agenda. While many cheer on Russia or Ukraine, the reality is that no matter what, people will lose as the elites get order out of chaos and allow one establishment to be replaced by another more technocratic establishment.

The world is about to dramatically change and people NEED to be prepared!

The B61-12 Mini-nukes “Made in America” to be Used in “A Nuclear First Strike”. Coming Soon to Italy, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands

Europe is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.

“Production of the B61-12 nuclear bomb begins,” Sandia National Laboratories announced from the United States. The B61-12, which replaces the previous B61 deployed by the U.S. at Aviano and Ghedi and other European bases, is a new type of weapon. It has a nuclear warhead with four power options, selectable depending on the target to be destroyed. It is not dropped vertically, but at a distance from the target on which it is directed guided by a satellite system. It can penetrate underground, exploding deep to destroy command center bunkers in a nuclear first strike.

The B61-12s, classified as “non-strategic nuclear weapons,” are deployed in Europe — in Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and probably other countries — at distances far enough to strike Russia. They thus have offensive capabilities similar to those of strategic weapons.

Another nuclear weapon system, which the United States is preparing to install in Europe against Russia, is ground-based intermediate-range missiles. They can also be launched from “anti-missile shield” installations, deployed by the U.S. at bases in Deveselu in Romania and Redzikowo in Poland, and aboard five warships cruising in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea close to Russia.

That such installations have offensive capabilities is confirmed by Lockheed Martin itself. Outlining the characteristics of the Mk 41 vertical launch system, used in both land and naval installations, it specifies that it is capable of launching “missiles for all missions, both defense and long-range attack, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.” These can be armed with nuclear warheads.

Europe is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.

 Judging from statements that a number of Western officials have made lately, one shall assume that there will be no compromises in the proxy war between the Russian Federation and the West.

On January 16, speaking at the meeting with heads of municipalities of Russian regions, President Putin said that Ukrainian statehood was on the verge of destruction:

""If this continues, then Ukrainian statehood may suffer an irreparable and very serious blow. This is their area of responsibility — this is the outcome of their policy and rule,” Putin said.

At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos that the conflict would need to escalate.

""Moscow has bluffed before with its threats. On the contrary, we need to escalate now because Putin understands only the language of force. If Russia's defeat leads to the collapse of the Putin regime, Europe may become safer and the world — freer and more democratic,"" Zelensky said.

Polish President Andrzej Duda supported Zelensky in Davos:

""The war will end when we force the Russians out of all the occupied territories. This is obvious to me.""

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, answering a question about a truce, noted in Davos that he did not see any conditions for a ceasefire.

""When you're going through hell, keep going.""

Winning the conflict is an existential question for all parties. The United States is the main instigator of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Today, it is the US that emerges as the main obstacle on the way to a ceasefire and then peace.

If the US agreed to sign an agreement with Russia, it would be tantamount to stopping NATO's expansion to the east and thus ending the dream of US global domination and exceptionalism. The United States will be clinging to every opportunity to keep and regain geopolitical advantage. Otherwise, the US financial system based on the dominance of the dollar will crumble. That would be lethal to Washington and the US will continue using Ukraine as a bargaining chip in fierce competition with Russia.

This suggests that hostilities in Ukraine will continue indefinitely until one of the parties is completely crushed and destroyed. Therefore, Russia has no other choice but to force the Kyiv regime to capitulate.

At the same time, due to internal contradictions in the United States, there is no funding for Kyiv. Ukraine needs $5 billion a month. Without this money, Ukraine is bankrupt, including at the front. Ukraine's manpower has been exhausted, let alone its production potential.

Russia has been developing its defence industry by leaps and bounds lately.

According to Stratfor, if there is a ceasefire agreement, it will be concluded on Russia's terms. Maintaining Russia's control over Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will neutralise Ukraine and prevent its entry into the European Union and NATO in the coming years, Stratfor analysts believe. It is not clear what borders Ukraine presently has. Moreover, Kyiv's formal control over territories does not coincide with reality.

Time will be working for Russia as it continues to develop its defence industry, increase the strength of its army and find ways to circumvent sanctions.

Russia's victory in the conflict in Ukraine would deal a terrible blow to the image of the United States. There is no more ""as long as it takes"" — it has been replaced with ""as long as we can"", Stratfor concludes.

The outcome of the special military operation in Ukraine will become clear to everyone in four to six months."

 Cash-strapped Pakistan made $364 million last year from a weapons agreement with two private US businesses to provide ammunition to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, according to a report.

According to BBC Urdu report published on Monday, a British military cargo plane flew from Pakistan Air Force Base Nur Khan in Rawalpindi to the British military base in Cyprus, Akrotiri, and then to Romania a total of five times to supply arms to the war-torn country.

Islamabad has, however, consistently denied that it has provided any ammunition to Ukraine, a neighbouring country to Romania.

The BBC story asserted that Pakistan had inked two contracts for the supply of 155mm rounds with American companies Global Military and Northrop Grumman, citing contract details from the US Federal Procurement Data System.

These arms deals with Ukraine were signed on 17 August, 2022, and they were particularly related to the acquisition of 155mm ammunition.

The Foreign Office in Islamabad has denied any sale of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, saying that Pakistan maintained a policy of strict neutrality in the dispute between the two countries and did not provide them with any arms or ammunition in that context.

These alleged agreements took place during the rule of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) - a multi-party coalition that ousted Imran Khan-led government through a no-trust vote in April last year.

Then Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had pledged to take Pakistan-UK relations to a “new height”, retired in November 2022.

In August 2022, when these alleged contracts were signed, the Ukraine crisis was very much a part of the political discourse in Pakistan, particularly in the wake of the cricketer-turned-politician Khan’s visit to Russia on February 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine.

Months after the visit, Gen Bajwa publicly distanced from Khan and called for the invasion to be stopped immediately.

During a visit to Pakistan this July, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also rejected reports that Pakistan was supplying arms to Ukraine to support its military during the ongoing conflict with Russia.

The BBC Urdu report claimed that a $232 million contract was awarded to Global Military while another $131 million contract was signed with Northrop Grumman. “These agreements expired last month i.e. October 2023, it added.

The report alleged that the deliveries were made in a British military cargo plane from the Nur Khan Air Base, which landed in Rawalpindi five times.

The first such plane landed in Rawalpindi in August 2022.

“Each time, the plane flew from Nur Khan Airbase to the British military base in Cyprus and then to Romania, that too at a time when Russia was waging war in Romania’s neighbouring country Ukraine, the report claimed.

BBC Urdu, while citing further evidence for its claims, said data by the State Bank of Pakistan also showed that the country’s arms exports increased by 3,000 per cent during FY 2022-23.

“Pakistan exported arms worth $13 million in 2021-22, while these exports reached $415 million in 2022-23,” it said.

Earlier reports said secret Pakistani arms sales to the US to be used by Ukraine helped cash-strapped Islamabad secure a crucial International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout earlier this year.

The arms sales were made for the purpose of supplying the Ukrainian military marking Pakistani involvement in a conflict it had faced US pressure to take sides on.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, rejected as baseless and fabricated the report which says the cash-strapped country provided arms to the US to get its support to clinch the USD 3 billion deal with the IMF towards the end of June to avoid default."

Ukrainian troops deployed the last large forces near Rabotino

Kyiv sent the last strategic reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (APU) to the area of the village of Rabotino, Zaporozhye region, according to the American magazine Forbes. This decision could significantly increase the region’s defense strength, but it also puts Ukraine in a potentially vulnerable position.

The deployed troops include the 82nd air assault brigade from the strategic reserve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, equipped with Marder and Stryker armored vehicles, as well as Challenger 2 tanks. Forbes emphasizes that the 82nd and 46th air assault brigades were the last major formations that The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was kept in reserve to respond to possible threats.

While such a move could strengthen Ukraine’s defensive position in the Rabotino region in the short term, such large formations are not capable of sustaining combat operations indefinitely. It is emphasized that when these brigades need rest, repair and restoration, they will not be replaced by equally combat-ready and trained units."

 AN emotional David Beckham said he ""can't imagine what Ukrainians have gone through"" at a summit meeting hosted by Piers Morgan.

The footie ace and father-of-four, who has been a UNICEF Goodwill ambassador for 17 years, appeared at the summit via a video link.

Beckham, 47, told the audience: ""Since the war in Ukraine began, I’ve been following the situation and speaking with UNICEF staff on the ground.

""I cannot imagine what the Ukrainian people have gone through these past five months, but I do know through my experience with UNICEF that getting back to routines through education and learning is a great healer for many children.""

In his message of support for Ukraine, the sporting star said he is ""always moved"" by the ""amazing spirit and determination"" of parents and ""children who have survived terrible disasters and conflict"".

Wearing a blue shirt and cream jacket, Beckham said: ""I’m frustrated that once again children are going through terrible trauma and pain, seeing things that no child should have to see.""

The acclaimed winger went on to discuss how he understood that children need routine - something he said his children lacked during the Covid-19 lockdowns.

He added: ""As a father, I’ve seen how a break in a child’s routine like the lockdowns we experienced during the Covid pandemic can affect children, their mood, their development, even their health.

""Whilst the war isn’t over, it’s important that whatever possible, we give children a chance to recover, to play, to meet new friends, to be close to their families and to start to regain their childhoods.""

Describing how ""school is about learning and [...] much more than that"", the co-owner of Salford City said he was ""lucky to have teachers and coaches who guided and encouraged me to achieve so much more"".

""All children deserve that and Ukrainian children must be protected and kept safe,"" Beckham reminded the audience.

""That is our duty – all of us as parents, leaders, mentors, and guides. And by recreating that feeling of safety, children will start to learn again and to dream of their futures.""

It comes after Piers Morgan praised Ukrainian President Zelensky and the First Lady for their resilience over the war with Russia.

The TalkTV host arrived in Kyiv earlier today to join Olena Zelenska for a summit meeting to help shine a light on the toll of Russia's invasion.

Zelensky's wife chaired the international event - The Second Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen - which marks the 150th day of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.

Piers was quick to praise the Presidential couple as ""inspiring"" before saying that it was a ""great privilege"" to be welcomed in Kyiv.

He said: ""I wanted to say to the First Lady just how inspiring the world finds you and your husband. The way that you have rallied the people of Ukraine, is amazing to watch.

“I had the honour of being invited here and I couldn’t wait to come to Ukraine and see for myself the resilience of the people here. You are a remarkable people.

“I have never met any country that has this strength and resilience with the possible exception of my country in World War Two.

“And I think it’s an amazing thing to watch, so I think you should be incredibly proud not just of your leaders but of the people.""

Alongside Piers, other famous faces participated remotely in the summit, including Richard Gere, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis."

The slave trade in Ukraine has become one of the most serious problems of our time. Since the 2014 coup d’état, Kiev has been a key player in modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the main factors for the growth of such human rights violations.

A recent investigative report published by the Foundation to Battle Injustice showed in details the seriousness of the slave trade in Ukraine. According to the organization, Kiev has become one of the main global hubs in the human trafficking market, with free exploitation and circulation of irregular workers – in addition to the well-known trafficking of women and children in the predatory sex market.

The study points out that more than 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market between 1991 and 2021. This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. These numbers are alarming and place Ukraine as one of the main agents of human trafficking in the entire world.

In its report, citing sources familiar with the topic and several insiders, the Foundation exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not limited to the exploitation of Ukrainian citizens. Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.

It is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe. Relatives of the Ukrainian parliamentarian also appear to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is legally registered in the name of people close to him, such as his brother, Mykola Stefanchuck, and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk.

Stefanchuk and his relatives’ companies have the function of disguising the slave trade, making it appear to be a legal business. Advertisements are made to “help” people in various ways, such as offering employment or financial assistance. Thus, migrants, refugees and vulnerable Ukrainians are lured into meetings and interviews by supposedly legal and responsible companies, but soon after the meetings their documents are confiscated, and these people are captured and handed over to criminal networks.

“Everything is built to look as legal as possible. Ukrainian women, children and men are invited for interviews at respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk. They are made tempting financial offers and paradisiacal working conditions. Then, under a plausible pretext, their identity cards are confiscated. After that, they can do absolutely anything they want with them,” source told investigators.

This type of situation is not surprising. In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country. It is worth remembering the case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia and has done important work exposing Kiev’s crimes. According to him, there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes in which Western officials are deeply involved."

 Russia's war in Ukraine poses the greatest threat to the global economy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, as Group of 20 ministers prepare to start talks in Bali.

Russia's war in Ukraine poses the greatest threat to the global economy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, as Group of 20 ministers prepare to start talks in Bali.

Moscow's invasion has sent inflation soaring at a time when the world is struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, endangering the gains of the past two years and threatening widespread hunger and poverty.

""Our greatest challenge today comes from Russia's illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine,"" she said ahead of a finance ministers and central bank governors’ meeting on Friday and Saturday.

""We are seeing negative spillover effects from that war in every corner of the world, particularly with respect to higher energy prices and rising food insecurity,"" she added.

""The international community must be clear-eyed about holding Putin accountable for the global economic and humanitarian consequences of his war.""

Yellen said she would continue to press G20 allies at the meeting for a price cap on Russian oil to choke off Putin's war chest and pressure Moscow to end its invasion while bringing down energy costs.

""A price cap [...] is one of our most powerful tools,"" she said, adding that a limit would deny Putin ""the revenue his war machine needs"".

She expressed hope that India and China would join such a cap, saying it ""would serve their own interests"" to put downward pressure on prices for consumers across the world.

But she refused to be drawn on whether Western officials would stage a multi-nation walkout when Russian officials speak, as they did at a G20 meeting in Washington in April.

""It cannot be business as usual,"" she said. ""I can tell you that I can certainly expect to express in the strongest possible terms my views on Russia's invasion [...] to talk about its impact on Ukraine and the entire global economy and to condemn it.""

""I expect that many of my colleagues will do the same.""

Global outlook 'darkened'

Russia's finance minister will not attend the Bali talks, instead addressing them virtually, a week after Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov found himself outnumbered by G20 counterparts in their criticism of Moscow's military assault.

Yellen's comments echo those of the head of the International Monetary Fund, who said on Wednesday that the global economic outlook had ""darkened significantly"" because of Moscow's invasion, just months after it revised down its global growth forecast for 2022 and 2023.

The IMF is ""projecting a further downgrade to global growth"" in 2022 and 2023, Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog post published ahead of this weekend's meeting.

The risk of ""social instability"" was also increasing because of rising food and energy prices, she wrote.

But there was substantive progress made in attempts to break the impasse on Wednesday after Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for their first direct talks since March on a deal to relieve the food crisis caused by blocked Black Sea grain exports.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called it a ""ray of hope to ease human suffering and alleviate hunger around the world"" ahead of another planned round of talks next week."
EN_UA_300142.txt,['Other'],['Other'],"Former Top FBI Official Pleads Guilty in Scheme to Help Russian Oligarch 

 A former high-ranking FBI counterintelligence official pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy and money laundering as he admitted to working for a Russian oligarch he once investigated after leaving the agency. His actions violated the sanctions against Russia.

Expressing deep remorse, Charles McGonigal pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the purpose of money laundering.

According to testimony before Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, Mr. McGonigal committed his violation of the IEEPA during the spring and fall of 2021, when he accepted over $17,000 to assist Russian energy mogul Oleg Deripaska by gathering negative information about one of Deripaska’s competitors.

Sentencing is set Dec. 14 for Mr. McGonigal, 55, who could spend up to five years in prison.

“After his tenure as a high-level FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, Charles McGonigal has now admitted that he agreed to evade U.S. sanctions by providing services to one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska,“ U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, according to the press release. ”This Office will continue to hold to account those who violate U.S. sanctions for their own financial benefit.”

Mr. Williams lauded the exceptional performance of the FBI New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division as well as the assistance provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the New York City Police Department.

The Former Agent’s PositionFrom 2016 to 2018, Mr. McGonigal oversaw the FBI’s counterintelligence operations in New York as special agent in charge. He directed probes of Russian oligarchs such as Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury in 2018.

In 2018, Washington banned nearly two dozen Russian billionaires and government officials in response to the now-debunked allegations of collusion between then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. Among those targeted was Mr. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum firm Rusal.

Mr. Deripaska’s sanctions were upheld by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the court found evidence he had acted as an agent for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Mr. McGonigal, who wept as he spoke about his crime, said Mr. Deripaska had sent him at least $17,000 via a bank in Cypress and a firm in New Jersey before depositing the money into his bank account.

In January 2023, authorities alleged that Mr. McGonigal had received undisclosed payments from Mr. Deripaska in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch and unsuccessfully pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on the Russian billionaire.

According to a news release issued by the Department of Justice on Jan. 23, it was alleged that Mr. McGonigal, on behalf of Mr. Deripaska, “fraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions.”

Connection to TrumpMr. McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organized crime before taking part in probes into the crash of TWA Flight 800, the 1998 terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

In 2016, he was promoted to head of the FBI’s New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division.

The DOJ was able to monitor Mr. Page’s communications because of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant issued during President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Former Department of Justice assertions that Mr. Page was “collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government” and had been the target of Russian intelligence recruitment efforts have since been debunked.

Mr. Page has always denied any collusion with the Russian government and has never been indicted in the Trump campaign probes."

 The United States is viewed much more favorably than China in 24 countries, most of which are high-income nations, amid growing competition between the two nations, according to the Pew Research Center.

“This year, overall views of the United States are much more positive than views of China in most places surveyed,” Pew Research noted. “But this has not always been the case in our nearly two decades of favorability polling, and views of the countries have fluctuated alongside views of their leaders.”

The poll found that 59 percent have a favorable view of the United States, while 28 percent hold a positive view of China. Regarding the leadership of both nations, 54 percent approve of President Joe Biden, while 19 percent feel the same way about Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

A total of 30,861 adults were surveyed from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023.

Across countries surveyed, Kenya and Nigeria hold more favorable views of China than the United States. But their ratings for Washington and Beijing are positive, with a favorable view of over 70 percent.

The survey also showed that public opinions for the United States and China vary across the countries surveyed.

In high-income countries, the differences in favor of the United States compared to China are much larger than in middle-income nations, with Poland and Japan having a gap of over 60 percentage points.

But in middle-income nations, positive ratings are seen for both countries, leading to a smaller public opinion gap.

The United States gets the lowest ratings in Hungary, where 44 percent hold a favorable view, compared with 55 percent in 2022.

The survey found that “a majority or plurality has favorable views of the United States but not China” in nine countries, such as Poland and Japan, where 63 percent hold a positive view of the United States but a negative view of China.

Most respondents said the United States interferes in other countries’ affairs but contributes to peace and stability worldwide. In Japan, 79 percent said the United States contributes a “fair amount” to global stability, while only 14 percent have the same view as China. Only respondents in Hungary consider that China contributes to world peace more than the United States.

Americans’ Views on ChinaIn May, another survey by the Pew Research Center found that over eight in ten Americans (83 percent) had unfavorable views of China, and the number of people who saw communist China as an enemy surged as the tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated in recent years.

Among 83 percent of Americans with unfavorable views of China, 44 percent said they had very negative views about China.

Around three-quarters of Americans (77 percent) had little or no confidence in Mr. Xi.

A rising number of Americans (38 percent) viewed China as an enemy compared to 25 percent in the January 2022 survey.

About half of American adults (52 percent) viewed China as a competitor, while only 6 percent considered it a partner.

The relationship between Washington and Beijing has deteriorated over the past few years. The two countries have clashed over various issues, such as Taiwan, trade, human rights, and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Beijing-Moscow relations were also a significant concern for Americans, particularly amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This issue concerned Americans more than any other issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including trade, Taiwan, or human rights.

Following Mr. Xi’s meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his Moscow visit in March, 62 percent of Americans see the China-Russia alliance as a severe problem for the United States.

For the Taiwan issue, poll respondents also see correlations between Russia’s treatment of Ukraine and the Chinese regime’s treatment of Taiwan, as many Americans hold much more favorable views of Taiwan (65 percent) than China (14 percent)."

 Hundreds of Indian MBBS students, who had to leave war-hit Ukraine in 2021, have resumed their studies in a leading medical university in Uzbekistan. The Samarkand State Medical University in Uzbekistan welcomed over 1,000 Indian medical students who were evacuated from Ukraine after the Indian Embassy there inquired about the possibility of a transfer for the affected students.

Amit, originally from Bihar’s Begusarai, experienced the Russian attack in Ukraine and spent one night in a basement. He was among the students evacuated by the Indian government through the ‘Operation Ganga’ initiative.

‘Operation Ganga’ was launched by the Indian government to bring back Indians stranded in Ukraine, resulting in the successful evacuation of a total of 18,282 Indian nationals under the initiative.

“I thought I wouldn’t make it and would either die or will be stranded in Ukraine. Once I was back home in India, me and my family were relieved but then began the never-ending cycle of uncertainty about what was next. I had finished three years of my MBBS in Ukraine and to start all over again or pursue something else was not an option I wanted to consider. I later decided to move to Uzbekistan,” Amit told PTI.

He says living expenses in Samarkand are higher than that of Ukraine but he is happy to be able to continue his education.

Tanwi Wadhva from Punjab’s Ferozepur, who was studying at Bukovinian State Medical University in Ukraine, was apprehensive about joining the university due to the loss of a semester.

“I attended online classes for eight months. We were hopeful that the war would end and we would go back. Some students even went back from different routes but I didn’t want to take that risk. I evaluated all options from Georgia to Poland and decided to come to Uzbekistan. The university admitted us a semester back, I was initially apprehensive about the loss of one semester but later I changed my mind and it was worth the decision,” she said.

Divyansh from Meerut who used to study at the same university as Wadhwa said Uzbekistan’s universities offered teaching and learning in English and the curriculum was on the same lines.

“Not all countries have universities which offer English as a medium of instruction. So that was a very important factor. Quality of life is similar in Ukraine and Samarkand but this place feels safer now,” he said.

Around 19,000 Indian students were studying in Ukraine when the Russian invasion began in February 2021.

According to estimates, approximately 2,000 Indian students have gone back to Ukraine and they are residing mostly in the western part of the East European country.

Several Indian medical students were left with no choice after their evacuation from Ukraine and transferred to universities in other countries to continue their studies. Many have gone to Russia, Serbia and other European countries.

Dr Zafar Aminov, Vice Chancellor, of Samarkand State Medical University, said when the war broke out, the Indian Embassy reached out to them enquiring if the affected students could seek a transfer.

“We evaluated the requirements of such students and then ultimately decided that enrolling them with a semester back would be a viable option to provide equivalence. We then set up a team to facilitate transfers and also made special arrangements for these students. We hired 30 more Indian teachers to ensure there are no accent issues,” he told PTI.

Aminov said the university has accommodated over 1,000 Indian transfer students from Ukraine.

Deepika Kaidala Jayaramaiah, a student from Karnataka, said after seeing the war situation right in front of her, moving to a peaceful country was the priority.

“I have only read about war in history books. Never imagined that I would witness the situation in person. After it was evident that going to Ukraine was not an option now, I decided to resume my medical journey in Uzbekistan,” she said."

 Davos: Henry Kissinger who feared a war over Ukraine’s NATO membership now calls it “appropriate outcome”. The former US Secretary of State, who is on the notorious Ukrainian “kill list”, addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, via video link. He said, “Before this war, I was opposed to the membership of Ukraine in NATO, because I feared it would start exactly the process that we have seen.” “Now, that this process has reached this level, the idea of a neutral Ukraine under these conditions is no longer meaningful,” he added. 

Kissinger said he wanted to express admiration for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the “heroic conduct of the Ukrainian people”. However, in no time, he went on to propose the same peace deal that he had put forward at Davos in May last year during which the former US Secretary of State advocated an urgent end to hostilities in Ukraine, lest Russia is “driven into a permanent alliance with China."" US should support Ukraine Kissinger argued that the US should continue to support and if required, intensify its military support for war-torn Ukraine until a ceasefire line is reached, or accepted, at preliminary talks with Russia. 

He also said the peace talks should begin once Ukrainian forces had reclaimed the territories occupied by Russia since the invasion began on February 24, 2022. Kissinger’s way to prevent escalation of conflict Kissinger said the only way to prevent the conflict from escalating is to do “exactly” what Ukraine, the US and its allies have been doing till now: “demand a Russian withdrawal, while Ukraine military and financial aid and maintaining sanctions and other pressures” on Moscow. 

He said that the destruction of Russia as a state that can pursue its own policies “will open up the vast area of its 11 time zones to internal conflict and to outside intervention at the time when there are 15,000 and more nuclear weapons on its territory.” “So this is why I believe in dialogue with Russia while the war continues, an end of fighting when the pre-war line is reached, and a continuing process of discussion by Europe, America and at that point Russia … while the conditions of sanctions and other pressures will be maintained until a final settlement is reached,” he added. Russia should be given ‘opening’ to rejoin the West Kissinger argued that Russia must be given an “opening” to rejoin the West, “if it meets the required conditions to participate as a member in these European processes"". 

He further said that the move could be important to avoid the perception that the conflict has become “against Russia itself,” which may cause Russians to re-evaluate both their historic “attraction to the culture of Europe and a fear of domination by Europe.” Kissinger also said the military alliance led by the US ought to be the guarantor of the final peace settlement “in whatever forms NATO can develop."" 

Who is Henry Kissinger? Aged 99, Kissinger was the US secretary of state between 1973-1977 under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He also served as the national security advisor between 1969 and 1975. He was a crucial part of the US detente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China. Kissinger also played a pivotal role in the talks to end the Vietnam War.

 Exposed: CIA Plotting WW3 With Russia! False Flags Continue As WEF Meet At Davos! - WAM Must Video

Josh Sigurdson reports on the recent news of the CIA committing sabotage attacks inside of Russia and Ukraine as the proxy war continues and shifts closer to a full global conflict.

Recently, an anti-air missile hit a residential apartment complex in Dnipro, Ukraine causing at least 44 casualties. While the Ukrainian government blamed Russia and the Russian government blamed Ukraine, a Ukrainian official has had to resign after accidentally admitting on live television that it was indeed a Ukrainian missile.

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by the name of Oleksiy Arestovych made the stunning claim on Ukrainian television leading to an obviously forced resignation within a day of the statement.

Meanwhile, investigative journalist Jack Murphy has exposed the CIA’s involvement in the conflict as they have been involved in targeted sabotage attacks and false flags within Ukraine and Russia, pushing the conflict further to the brink.

Ukraine’s Defense Minister, Oleksii Reznikov has also been pushing the bar forward as he claims that Ukraine is a de-facto member of NATO.

This is clearly a scripted proxy war to bring the world into conflict and then, of course, the Great Reset. Keep in mind that this conflict was talked about for years by the World Economic Forum which is currently convening in Davos."

Russia could shut 30% of its crude oil output from April if it doesn’t find buyers

Russia could be forced to cut crude production by nearly a third starting next month, as traders are reportedly reluctant to buy oil from the country amid Western sanctions, the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday.

“The prospect of large-scale disruptions to Russian oil production is threatening to create a global oil supply shock. We estimate that from April, 3 mb/d [million barrels per day] of Russian oil output could be shut in as sanctions take hold and buyers shun exports,” the agency writes in its latest Oil Market Report.

Only Saudi Arabia and the UAE hold substantial spare capacity that could immediately help to offset a Russian shortfall, the Agency says, adding that other OPEC nations are complying with the agreement to increase supply by “modest” monthly amounts.

According to the IEA, surging commodity prices and international sanctions against Russia following its military operation in Ukraine are expected to “appreciably depress global economic growth.”

The US, the UK, Canada, and Australia banned imports of Russian oil earlier this month, affecting some 13% of Russia’s exports. International oil companies quit joint ventures with Russian crude oil producers, overseas banks stopped dealing with Moscow, and the European Union announced a ban on investment in Russia's energy sector.

Brent crude futures jumped nearly 6% on Thursday to nearly $104 per barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude is gaining over 5% and trading above $100 a barrel.

Eric Kaufmann: Populists Are Losing This War

Eric Kaufmann thinks we are losing the war.

The latest CBS News poll shows strong support for imposing sanctions on Russia, implementing a No-Fly Zone and a willingness to pay higher gas prices to punish Russia. Vladimir Putin also polls poorly with Republican voters. The hawks clearly think that they are on the upswing in the GOP.

“Back in February, we had a pretty good idea what was going on. Video and satellite imagery had shown the steady increase and massing of Russian troops, tanks, and military supplies around Ukraine’s borders. Vladimir Putin had started wars before — and here he was again, on the precipice of something truly horrific.

What bothered me was the extent to which several high-profile populist conservatives were seeming to reflexively side with the cruel Russian autocrat. I watched as Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance defended Putin, or adopted the Kremlin’s critique of Ukraine. The country was a “pure client state of the United States State Department” said Carlson. “Spare me the performative affection for the Ukraine” said Vance on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast.

These interventions, made as Russia began an invasion that looks set to result in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, look high risk and low reward. These commentators are undermining the credibility they have accrued for taking bold stances on the “security and identity” issues their base really cares about. Namely: wokeness, the border, crime and defending national heritage. …”

In the aftermath of Russia's move to shut a major pipeline, prices of European gas surged 20 per cent, Bloomberg reported. It caused fears that the move will lead to a prolonged supply halt.

The report mentioned that benchmark futures rose toward 300 euros a megawatt hour. The electricity and coal prices also surge to fresh records.

The recent developments show that the Europeans are preparing for a difficult winter without gas supplies from Russia. It is part of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which started after Russia announced the invasion of its neighbouring country on February 24.

In the report, it is mentioned that the key Nord Stream pipeline will stop for three days of maintenance on August 31. This has raised concerns that the link won't return to service as planned after the works.

This comes after Bulgaria announced that it will seek talks with Russian energy giant Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas ahead of the winter season.

The deliveries were cut by Gazprom to Bulgaria in late April after the EU member's previous centrist government refused to pay in rubles.

Ever since the supplies were cut, the nation, which is almost totally dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of 3.0 billion cubic metres of natural gas, had been looking for alternative deliveries.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday (August 22) at the start of a two-day trip. During this crucial trip, the two leaders are expected to discuss energy cooperation.

Notable, Ukraine is at odds with Germany over its gas imports policy.

 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses an annual press conference in Budapest, Hungary, December 21, 2022. 

The single or ""biggest loser"" of the Russia-Ukraine conflicts which triggered EU sanctions against Russia is Europe and the U.S. is the winner of the conflicts, said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, reiterating his stand in an interview with Hungarian television on Friday.

He pointed out that the EU is not brave enough to admit that its sanctions policy is wrong, and Hungary is not capable enough to change the position of other larger countries, so sanctions against Russia, though ineffective, are likely to remain in place.

Orban previously said that Europe, for its ally the U.S., gave up Russian energy and was forced to pay 5 to 10 times of fee for energy, which had also driven up inflation.

According to the data published by the Hungarian central statistics office on Friday, Hungary's average consumer price index (CPI) rose by 14.5 percent in 2022, compared with 5.1 percent in 2021. And Hungary's CPI in December 2022 rose by 24.5 percent compared with the same month in 2021, the highest increase since March 1996. Food prices in Hungary also rose by 44.8 percent in December 2022, compared to the same month in 2021.

Since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, Europe has encountered a severe energy crisis. Bloomberg reported that Europe lost one trillion U.S. dollars by rejecting Russian energy while the U.S. is selling its LNG to Europe at three to four times the price in the U.S., which drew criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron, saying it is a practice that ""is not what true friends would do and must stop.""

BUDAPEST—The European Union has “shot itself in the lungs” with ill-considered economic sanctions on Russia, which, unless rolled back, risk destroying the European economy, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday.
Gas supplies to Europe have tightened and fuel costs have soared since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February and subsequent sanctions, leaving countries scrambling to refill storage and diversify supply channels.

The surge in gas and electricity prices forced Orban to curtail a years-long cap on utility prices for higher-usage households on Wednesday, rolling back one of the 59-year-old prime minister’s signature economic policies.

“Initially, I thought we had only shot ourselves in the foot, but now it is clear that the European economy has shot itself in the lungs, and it is gasping for air,” Orban told public radio in an interview.

Orban said Ukraine needed help, but European leaders should reconsider their strategy, as sanctions have caused widespread damage to the European economy without weakening Russia or bringing the months-long war closer to any resolution.

“The sanctions do not help Ukraine, however, they are bad for the European economy and if it goes on like this, they will kill off the European economy,” Orban said. “What we see right now is unbearable.”

“The moment of truth must come in Brussels, when leaders admit they have made a miscalculation, that the sanctions policy was based on wrong assumptions and it must be changed.”
Re-elected in April, Orban said without Wednesday’s curbs, which will trigger a jump in energy costs for households consuming energy above the national average, the entire utility price cap regime would have to be scrapped.

Economists at Morgan Stanley have said the curbs could add 1.5 percentage points to inflation, already at its highest in two decades, further exacerbated by a weak forint.
Before the April ballot, economists estimated the cost of the utility price caps at up to 1.5 trillion forints ($3.71 billion), which along with a raft of measures that helped Orban’s election bid have caused a surge in the budget deficit.

Orban is facing his toughest challenge yet since taking power in a 2010 landslide, with inflation at its highest in two decades, the forint plumbing record lows and European Union funds in limbo amid a dispute over democratic standards.

Orban’s other decision to fast-track legislation to raise the tax rate for hundreds of thousands of small firms this week as part of a broader drive to rein in the ballooning budget deficit has led to several protests in Budapest."
EN_UA_DEV_26.txt,['URW: Russia is the Victim'],['URW: Russia is the Victim: Other'],"How Nikita Khrushchev Exposed the Hypocrisy of US Interventions 

 For American interventionists living today, all that one needs to know is that Russia invaded Ukraine. End of story. Black and white. Russia bad. Ukraine good. Support Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded cash and armaments. America good.

If we go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, we find that things are not so simple, especially for American interventionists, even if they don’t realize it.
The Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba that had the capability of hitting U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and New York City. The crisis lasted from October 16 through October 29, 1962.

President Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites, followed by a full-scale regime-change military invasion of the island. In other words, they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine. In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”

On October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:
But how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.

You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.

Do you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.

The fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.

But even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA, he was willing to risk all-out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles, even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install them in Cuba. He, the Pentagon, and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States.

But that’s precisely how the Soviets felt as well, which is what Khrushchev was expressing in his letter to Kennedy. He was essentially saying, “Hey, you don’t like our missiles in Cuba because they are so close to your country. That’s exactly how we feel as well, not only about your missiles over here that are painted at us but also about all your military bases with which you have surrounded us. How come you can’t understand that?”

Well, Kennedy did come to understand that. That’s how he and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal, one that infuriated the U.S. national-security establishment as well as American interventionists.
The deal consisted of two major parts: First, Kennedy vowed that he would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and, second, Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff were livid. They considered Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history. They compared his actions during the crisis to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich.

For their part, American interventionists were also furious over Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis. As far as they were concerned, the Pentagon and the CIA had the “right” to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the “right” to do the same. It’s a position that American interventionists still hold today.

Can you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to “national security”?"
