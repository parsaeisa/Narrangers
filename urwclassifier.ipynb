A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.\\n\\nEnvironmental guilt was more effective than the green \\\"good for the planet\\\" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.\\n\\nBritish consumers already are used to the \\\"traffic-light\\\" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.\\n\\nA new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.\\n\\nTheir study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThey tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.\\n\\nThey had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, \\\"This item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change,\\\" to green one which read, \\\"This item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.\\\"\\n\\nThe study found red labels to be the most effective at 23.5% more than the comparative choosing nonbeef in the control group.\\n\\nOnly 10% of people chose green, compared to the control group.\\n\\nThe lead author of the study, professor Julia Wolfson, an expert in food policy at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the results showed an effectiveness with the red-style labeling.\\n\\n\\\"We found that labeling red meat items with negatively framed, red high\\u2013climate impact labels was more effective at increasing sustainable selections than labeling non-red meat items with positively framed, green low\\u2013climate impact labels,\\\" she said.\\n\\nWolfson added those who were likely to choose green labels tended to eat healthier than the control. This is despite no fast food included on the menu.\\n\\nShe said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.\\n\\n\\\"It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,\\\" Wolfson said.\",\n          \"Watch incredible first-person video as Russian pilot EJECTS and haplessly watches his plane crash after being shot down \\n\\n INCREDIBLE footage shows a panicked Russian pilot ejecting from his plane and watching as it crashes in a fireball after being shot down.\\n\\nThe explosion could be seen miles away after the jet was taken down by what is thought to be Ukrainian fire.\\n\\nThe fighter pilot had to release his parachute mid-air and was forced to land in an abandoned field.\\n\\nThe shocking first-person footage is believed to have been recorded in the summer but wasn't released until now.\\n\\nIt shows the Russian fighter pilot release his parachute mid-air after his Su-25SM was taken down by what's believed to have been incoming Ukrainian fire, according to a weapons tracking account on Twitter.\\n\\nThe aircraft nose-dives into the ground, unleashing a hellish explosion that can be seen from miles away while the pilot lands safety in an abandoned field.\\n\\nREAD MORE ON WORLD NEWS\\n\\nIt is unclear what happened to the pilot since the recording but some observers claim the flight crashed during a planned training run in Belgorod region, Russia.\\n\\nIt comes as astonishing footage shows the moment a Ukrainian tank opened fire in a vicious battle against Russian forces.\\n\\nFierce fighting can be seen in the video as the 46-tonne T-84 main battle tank blasts its 125mm cannon towards Putin's men during the bloody clash that is understood to have occurred near Kherson.\\n\\nUkrainian forces are seen engaging nearly point-blank with a Russian convoy who appear to have blundered into them as they drove up a dirt road.\\n\\nMost read in The Sun\\n\\nTrucks emblazoned with the \\\"Z\\\" symbol can see attempting to rush past the tank - only for soldiers on the ground to then open fire on them.\\n\\nThe bearded gunner in the tank's turret ducks down as gunfire can be heard all around him.\\n\\nWith the snaps of bullets and the boom of tank guns, the convoy - with a truck towing a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier - grind to a halt.\\n\\nOther clips released as part of the video package shows the gunner opening fire on unseen foes with his heavy machine gun.\\n\\nIt's believed Mad Vlad would happily sacrifice 20 million soldiers to ensure he won the war in Ukraine and secure his future as Russia's leader, a former insider has claimed.\\n\\nThe chilling warning comes as fears of the war in Ukraine turning nuclear continue to grow as Russia's defence minister said a \\\"dirty bomb\\\" could be detonated in Ukraine.\\n\\nExiled former diplomat Boris Bondarev warned Putin would sacrifice millions of lives to win in Ukraine.\\n\\n\\\"He is not smart, he is just lucky. Now I think his luck is over,\\\" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.\\n\\n\\\"You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.\\n\\n\\\"It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.\\\"\\n\\nBondarev added: \\\"After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.\\n\\n\\\"And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking \\\"uncontrolled escalation\\\" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.\\n\\nShoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a \\\"dirty bomb\\\" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.\\n\\nAnd while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.\\n\\nBut it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.\\n\\nPutin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.\\n\\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\\n\\nRead More on The Sun\\n\\nAnd so Shoigu's warning sparks fears over what the Russians may be planning as they are beaten back across the frontline.\\n\\nAs expected, Russia presented no evidence for their claims.\",\n          \"EU\\u2019s top diplomat angry at Hungarian FM for labeling EU \\u2018pro-war\\u2019 \\n\\n Josep Borrell, the EU\\u2019s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Hungarian Foreign Minister P\\u00e9ter Szijj\\u00e1rt\\u00f3\\u2019s accusation that the European Union is \\u201cpro-war\\u201d completely unacceptable,\\n\\n\\u201cThis is totally unacceptable.

A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.\\n\\nEnvironmental guilt was more effective than the green \\\"good for the planet\\\" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.\\n\\nBritish consumers already are used to the \\\"traffic-light\\\" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.\\n\\nA new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.\\n\\nTheir study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThey tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.\\n\\nThey had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, \\\"This item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change,\\\" to green one which read, \\\"This item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.\\\"\\n\\nThe study found red labels to be the most effective at 23.5% more than the comparative choosing nonbeef in the control group.\\n\\nOnly 10% of people chose green, compared to the control group.\\n\\nThe lead author of the study, professor Julia Wolfson, an expert in food policy at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the results showed an effectiveness with the red-style labeling.\\n\\n\\\"We found that labeling red meat items with negatively framed, red high\\u2013climate impact labels was more effective at increasing sustainable selections than labeling non-red meat items with positively framed, green low\\u2013climate impact labels,\\\" she said.\\n\\nWolfson added those who were likely to choose green labels tended to eat healthier than the control. This is despite no fast food included on the menu.\\n\\nShe said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.\\n\\n\\\"It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,\\\" Wolfson said.\",\n          \"Watch incredible first-person video as Russian pilot EJECTS and haplessly watches his plane crash after being shot down \\n\\n INCREDIBLE footage shows a panicked Russian pilot ejecting from his plane and watching as it crashes in a fireball after being shot down.\\n\\nThe explosion could be seen miles away after the jet was taken down by what is thought to be Ukrainian fire.\\n\\nThe fighter pilot had to release his parachute mid-air and was forced to land in an abandoned field.\\n\\nThe shocking first-person footage is believed to have been recorded in the summer but wasn't released until now.\\n\\nIt shows the Russian fighter pilot release his parachute mid-air after his Su-25SM was taken down by what's believed to have been incoming Ukrainian fire, according to a weapons tracking account on Twitter.\\n\\nThe aircraft nose-dives into the ground, unleashing a hellish explosion that can be seen from miles away while the pilot lands safety in an abandoned field.\\n\\nREAD MORE ON WORLD NEWS\\n\\nIt is unclear what happened to the pilot since the recording but some observers claim the flight crashed during a planned training run in Belgorod region, Russia.\\n\\nIt comes as astonishing footage shows the moment a Ukrainian tank opened fire in a vicious battle against Russian forces.\\n\\nFierce fighting can be seen in the video as the 46-tonne T-84 main battle tank blasts its 125mm cannon towards Putin's men during the bloody clash that is understood to have occurred near Kherson.\\n\\nUkrainian forces are seen engaging nearly point-blank with a Russian convoy who appear to have blundered into them as they drove up a dirt road.\\n\\nMost read in The Sun\\n\\nTrucks emblazoned with the \\\"Z\\\" symbol can see attempting to rush past the tank - only for soldiers on the ground to then open fire on them.\\n\\nThe bearded gunner in the tank's turret ducks down as gunfire can be heard all around him.\\n\\nWith the snaps of bullets and the boom of tank guns, the convoy - with a truck towing a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier - grind to a halt.\\n\\nOther clips released as part of the video package shows the gunner opening fire on unseen foes with his heavy machine gun.\\n\\nIt's believed Mad Vlad would happily sacrifice 20 million soldiers to ensure he won the war in Ukraine and secure his future as Russia's leader, a former insider has claimed.\\n\\nThe chilling warning comes as fears of the war in Ukraine turning nuclear continue to grow as Russia's defence minister said a \\\"dirty bomb\\\" could be detonated in Ukraine.\\n\\nExiled former diplomat Boris Bondarev warned Putin would sacrifice millions of lives to win in Ukraine.\\n\\n\\\"He is not smart, he is just lucky. Now I think his luck is over,\\\" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.\\n\\n\\\"You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.\\n\\n\\\"It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.\\\"\\n\\nBondarev added: \\\"After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.\\n\\n\\\"And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking \\\"uncontrolled escalation\\\" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.\\n\\nShoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a \\\"dirty bomb\\\" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.\\n\\nAnd while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.\\n\\nBut it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.\\n\\nPutin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.\\n\\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\\n\\nRead More on The Sun\\n\\nAnd so Shoigu's warning sparks fears over what the Russians may be planning as they are beaten back across the frontline.\\n\\nAs expected, Russia presented no evidence for their claims.\",\n          \"EU\\u2019s top diplomat angry at Hungarian FM for labeling EU \\u2018pro-war\\u2019 \\n\\n Josep Borrell, the EU\\u2019s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Hungarian Foreign Minister P\\u00e9ter Szijj\\u00e1rt\\u00f3\\u2019s accusation that the European Union is \\u201cpro-war\\u201d completely unacceptable,\\n\\n\\u201cThis is totally unacceptable.

America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia\\u2019s central command \\u2014 far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).\\n\\nHere, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government\\u2019s increasing aggression against Russia \\u2014 using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:\\n\\nThe Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine\\u2019s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President \\u2014 and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be \\u2018democratically elected\\u2019, and so to continue the U.S.-Government\\u2019s control over that country, on Russia\\u2019s border.\\n\\nFor the full details, see this.\\n\\nSo: all three of those phrases (\\u201cRussia\\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine\\u201d, \\u201cunprovoked war in Ukraine\\u201d, and \\u201cRussian aggression against Ukraine\\u201d) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine \\u2014 which is America\\u2019s proxy in its war against Russia \\u2014 but actually Russia).\\n\\nThe war in Ukraine started with Obama\\u2019s coup, not with Putin\\u2019s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America\\u2019s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia\\u2019s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).\\n\\nAmerica\\u2019s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine\\u2019s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia\\u2019s central command \\u2014 too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.\\n\\nWhat is the power of lies?\\n\\nIn a U.N. General Assembly vote on November 14th, the U.N. General Assembly (which has no power) voted by 94 votes for, 73 abstentions, and only 14 votes against, a Resolution to demand that Russia pay restitution to Ukraine, for the war in Ukraine \\u2014 that America started against Russia by its 2014 coup.\",\n          \"Putin\\u2019s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds \\n\\n Putin\\u2019s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds\\n\\nRUSSIAN prisoners who have tested positive for HIV are choosing to be sent to the frontline hoping to get lifesaving medication.\\n\\nA large number of Vladimir Putin's HIV-positive prisoner recruits deemed they preferred the battlefield rather than rot in jail where they were denied treatment.\\n\\nThe Wagner Group has been mass-recruiting inmates from Russia's infamous prisons, offering them a pardon if they survive for six months.\\n\\nUkrainian officials estimate about 20 per cent of recruits in Russian prisoner units are HIV positive.\\n\\nAnd a lot of them were so desperate for the anti-viral medications they couldn't get in jail, they opted to join Putin's bloody war in Ukraine, the New York Times reported.\\n\\nSpeaking from a detention centre in Dnipro, an HIV-positive Russian soldier named Timur, 37, told the newspaper: \\\"Conditions were very harsh.\\\"\\n\\nread more in russia\\n\\nHe said how doctors in prison changed the anti-viral medication to a different type that he suspected was not effective.\\n\\nFearing he was not going to last his ten-year sentence behind bars, agreed to join Putin's bloodthirsty Wagner Group for six months in exchange for a pardon and supplies of anti-viral medications.\\n\\nSpeaking about the dilemma of poor treatment in prison or fight in Ukraine, he said: \\\"I understood I would have a quick death or a slow death. I chose a quick death.\\\"\\n\\nTimur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.\\n\\nMost read in The Sun\\n\\nHe said that the unit's commanders \\\"repeated many times, \\u2018if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.\\u2019\\\"\\n\\nWhile he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.\\n\\nAnother soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.\\n\\nHe said: \\\"If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.\\\"\\n\\nNew conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these \\\"sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands\\\".\\n\\n\\\"In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,\\\" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.\\n\\nThe report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside \\\"infected\\\" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.\\n\\nAnother HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.\\n\\nHe said: \\\"There were no conditions for the HIV infected.\\n\\n\\\"We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.\\\"\\n\\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\\n\\nIt is estimated a total of 50,000 prisoners have signed up to fight in Ukraine, roughly 10 per cent of the incarcerated population.\\n\\nWagner's chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as \\\"Putin's chef\\\", was pictured trying to recruit inmates from Russia's penal colonies, promising them their freedom in return for six months on the frontline.\",\n          \"Zelensky Enemy of Ukraine Sends In The Last Reserves \\n\\n Zelensky Enemy of Ukraine Sends In The Last Reserves\\n\\nWill Putin\\u2019s army capture the formerly British Challengers and add them to his Moscow museum ?\\n\\nUkrainian troops deployed the last large forces near Rabotino\\n\\nKyiv sent the last strategic reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (APU) to the area of the village of Rabotino, Zaporozhye region, according to the American magazine Forbes. This decision could significantly increase the region\\u2019s defense strength, but it also puts Ukraine in a potentially vulnerable position.\\n\\nThe deployed troops include the 82nd air assault brigade from the strategic reserve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, equipped with Marder and Stryker armored vehicles, as well as Challenger 2 tanks. Forbes emphasizes that the 82nd and 46th air assault brigades were the last major formations that The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was kept in reserve to respond to possible threats.\\n\\nWhile such a move could strengthen Ukraine\\u2019s defensive position in the Rabotino region in the short term, such large formations are not capable of sustaining combat operations indefinitely. It is emphasized that when these brigades need rest, repair and restoration, they will not be replaced by equally combat-ready and trained units.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
